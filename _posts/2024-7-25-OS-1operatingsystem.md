## ‚úÖ Operating System

> collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs <br>
> communication channel between system hardware and system software <br>

## ‚òëÔ∏è Functions of OS

1. Processor Management
   - start, stop, manage process, program
   - ‚≠êÔ∏è scheduling

2. Memory Management
   - ‚≠êÔ∏è manage primary memory
   - optimize memory use
   - ‚≠êÔ∏è virtual memory
   - ‚≠êÔ∏è file system
3. Networking
   - establish, manange network connections
   - network protocols
   - share files, printers over network
   - ‚≠êÔ∏è TCP/IP
4. User Interface
   - interface for users to interact w the computer
   - GUI: Graphical User Interface

## ‚òëÔ∏è Detailed Explanation of functions

1. Processor Management

- Processor Scheduling
  - determines which process has access to processor
  - how much processig time each process has
- Process
  - keep track of status of process
  - traffic controller
  - allocates CPU to process
  - when process is no longer required, de-allocates

2. Memory Management

- for a program to be run, needs to be loaded in the main memory
- OS manages allocation, deallocation of memory

3. Networking

- Network communication
  - cops for internet traffic
  - manage how data is packaged and sent over a network
  - check if the data arrived safely and in correct order
- Settings and Monitoring
  - network connections(WIFI)

4. User Interface

   > user ‚û°Ô∏è OS ‚û°Ô∏è computer interface
   > high level language ‚û°Ô∏è interpreter ‚û°Ô∏è machine language

5. Device Driver

- manages hardware
- decide which process gets acess to a certain device and for how long, and deallocate

6. Job Accounting

- if more than one user is using the OS
- track resource usage of particular user
- determine which application should run in which order, allocation
