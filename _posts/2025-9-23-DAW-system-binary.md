## ✅ Positive Integer

- Integer: 8bits
- there are two ways to encode positive integers into binary

#### 1️⃣ Use dividing by 2

- divide the `Integer` by 2 several times
- take the final quotient and the remainders
- from down to up, write the quotient and remainder down

```
33/2 = quotient: 16, remainder: 1
16/2 = quotient: 8, remainder: 0
8/2 = quotient: 4, remainder: 0
4/2 = quotient: 2, remainder: 0
2/2 = quotient: 1, remainder: 0
from down to up, 33 = 1(quotient) and 00001
👉🏻 33 = 100001
```

#### 2️⃣ Use the weights rule of the power of 2

- use the `weights rule` of the powers of 2
- draw positions, and each position is double to the one at the right
- then add `1` in positions needed and `0` in positions not needed

```
33 =  __  __  __  __  __  __
      32  16   8   4   2   1
  👉🏻  1    0   0   0    0  1

❓ 0 = 00000000
❓ 255 = 11111111
```

## ✅ Negative Integer

> 🚩 Sign Flag

- 1️⃣ Change the positive `Integer` into binary
- 2️⃣ Add a `1` at the very left, this is a special `1`
- ⭐️ **Sign flag:** special `1` to indicate that this `Integer` is a negative Integer
- This special `1` is stored in a different place
- sign flag means this `Integer` is a negative
  🚩 **Flags** are electric signals stored in specific places for special circumstances

- If the flag is off, you add it as part of the number
- If the flag in on, you turn it into a negative symbol

```
❓ code -78 to binary
78 = 01001110
➕ add 1 on the left, why make 8 spaces? bc 8bits
👉🏻 101001110

❓ code -16 to binary
16 = 00010000
➕ add 1 on the left
👉🏻 100010000
```

## ✅ Decimal Integer

> FLU(Floating Point Unit)

- Decimal numbers are stored in a special place called **FLU(Floating Point Unit)**
- The convention used for this is `IEEE754` for international technique, `IE3754`. The steps are as following

- 1️⃣ Take the `Integer` part, transform into binary **but** discord all the `0s` at the left
- no extra `0s`
- 2️⃣ Take the Decimal part `0.xxx`, then **multiply by 2 five times**, but discarding the appearing `1s` into `0s`. You take the `0s` and the `1s` AFTER the `=` from **up to down**
- 👉🏻 now put it together with the coded integer + decimal part
- 3️⃣ The dot needs to be represented, and the decimal part is always `5bits`. We are going to shift the decimal symbol(the dot) to the left until you leave it after the `FIRST 1`. AND you count how many steps/jumps you had to take. -Move the dot to the left until you reach the first number
- ⭐️ In computing, we want things to always occupy the same number, this is a rule. NO variable length, always fixed length. So, we want the decimal to occupy `32 bits`.
- 4️⃣ To the number of steps/jumps, add 127 and then you code the result.
- 5️⃣ We place that at the END of the number, leaving extra space in between, the `IEEE754` want the number to occupy `32bits`
- 6️⃣ In order to have `32bits`, if the number is negative, add a `1` at the left and BESIDES you light the sign flag. If the number is positive, add a `0`, so that it occupies the same number as a negative one.
  - add 1 to the left if negative
  - or add 0 to the left if positie
- 7️⃣ We complete with `0s` in order for it to sum up to `32bits`

```
❓ code -17.33 to binary
1️⃣ Integer part into binary
17 = 00010001 ➡️ discord all the left 0s ➡️ 10001
2️⃣ Decimal part, multiply by 2, five times
0.33 * 2 = 0.66 ➡️ 0
0.66 * 2 = 1.32 ➡️ 1
0.32 * 2 = 0.64 ➡️ 0
0.64 * 2 = 1.28 ➡️ 1
0.28 * 2 = 0.56 ➡️ 0
👉🏻 01010
then add to 17
👉🏻 10001.01010
3️⃣ move the . to after the first number, count the jumps
👉🏻 1.000101010
count the jumps = 4
4️⃣ Add 127 to the number of jumps
4 + 127 = 131
👉🏻 change 131 to binary  =  10000011
5️⃣ add the number 10000011 to the end with a space in between
👉🏻 1.000101010 ---space--- 10000011
6️⃣ If number is negative, add 1, if positive, add 0
👉🏻 11000101010 ---space--- 10000011 (19 digits)
7️⃣ Fill the space w 0s, so it occupys 32 bits
11000101010 0000000000000 10000011
----------- ------------- --------
1(neg) + 17      13 0s     4jumps + 127

👉🏻11000101010000000000000010000011
```

```
❓ code -28.46 to binary
1️⃣ integer: 28 = 11100
2️⃣ decimal: multiply by 2 five times
0.46 * 2 = 0.92
0.92 * 2 = 1.84
0.84 * 2 = 1.68
0.68 * 2 = 1.36
0.36 * 2 = 0.72
👉🏻 01110
👉🏻 11100.01110
3️⃣ move the .
👉🏻 1.110001110
steps: 4 times
4️⃣ add 127 to steps
4 + 127 = 131 = 10000011
5️⃣ add the number to the end with space
👉🏻 1.110001110 ---space--- 10000011
6️⃣ neg: add 1, pos: add 0
👉🏻 11110001110 ---space--- 10000011(19digits)
7️⃣ Fill the space w 0s
11110001110 0000000000000 10000011
              (13 0s)
```

- all the numbers that use this protocals are called `floats` since they are stored in the FPU
- If instead of `32bits`, we made this in `64bits(The standard is totally different procedure)`, we call them `double floats`
- `Double floats` have more precision, always more than 2 decimals.
- ⚠️ It is considered a bad programming technique to use double floats with things that could be in a regular float, since it is more accerlerated, more work for the PC.

## ✅ Text

#### ☑️ Standard Text, `Extended ASCII`

- for `Standard Text`, we use `Extended ASCII`
- `Extended ASCII` is a `FLC-8`, each character is `8bits`
- each character 🟰 `Integer`
- so you can code the `Integer` with the weights rule
- there are no spaces
- If you need a space, code the `number 32`
- 👎🏻 However, `Extended ASCII` uses only `256 characters(from 0 to 255)`

```
❓ Transform I_miss_you with ASCII code.
73 32 109 105 115 115 32 121 111 117 46

01001001001000000110110101101001………00101100
```

#### ☑️ Extension of ASCII, `UTF-8`

- `UTF-8` is an extension of the `extended ASCII`
- also known as **Unicode**
- bc it is to be used with every language int he world
- UTF `8` does not mean `8bits` per symbol
- it means `multiple of 8bits` per symbol
- Some symbols are `8bits(1byte)` like `ASCII`
- Some symbols are `16bits(2bytes)` like `Greek, Cyrilic, Hebew, Arab...`
- Some symbols are `24bits(3bytes)` like `Korean`
- Some symbols are `32bits(4bytes)` like `Persian, Fenician, old languages and ALSO math`

- Each language, if possible uses its own version of `ASCII`
- but due to Internet, a code was invented to allow intercommunication and translation between different languages

## ✅ Image

### ☑️ Two types of pictures

#### 1️⃣ Raster

- divided into **pixels**, get pixelized when increase size
- `JPG`, `gig`, `png`
- HR: Horizontal Resolution: how many pixels in horizontal
- VR: Vertical Resolution: how many pixels in vertical
- Resolution = HR \* VR

#### ✔️ Color Depth in Raster

- **Color Depth**: how many bits you need for your image
- `1` or `8` or `24`
- black and white ➡️ need 2 combos, need `1 bit(2^1)` ➡️ color depth: 1
- gray-scaled ➡️ need 256 combos, need `8 bits(2^8)` ➡️ color depth: 8
- full-colored ➡️ every color is `R(0~255) + G(0~255) + B(0~255)` ➡️ each R, G, B need 8 bits ➡️ need `24 bits` ➡️ color depth: 24

  - pure red would be `255.0.0`
  - pure green would be `0.255.0`
  - black would be `0.0.0`
  - white would be `255.255.255`
  - as soon as there is one colored pixel, even if all pixels are black and white, color depth will be 24
  - if full color, each pixel will have 24bits, graphic card will write the bits

- color codes are stored in graphic cards, in the driver
- Red = `111111110000000000000000`
- I can use up to `2^24` colors, more or less 16000000(16 million)
  - `(2^4)*(2^10)*(2^10)` = more or less 16 _ 1000 _ 1000
- If a graphic card had 64bytes, it can have `2^64` colors

  - `(2^4)*(2^10)*(2^10)*(2^10)*(2^10)*(2^10)*(2^10)`

#### ✔️ Picture size in Raster

- Picture size = `HR * VR * D(color depth)`

```
Q: How many bits would a black and white picture have of 100 * 50?
- Picture size = HR * VR * D(color depth)
- 100 * 50 * 1 = 5000
```

```
Q: How many bits would a gray picture have of 100 50?
- Picture size = HR * VR * D(color depth)
- 100 *  50 * 8 = 40000
```

```
Q. If all the sound that my computer can make are 8, how many bits do my computer have?
- 3
- because 2^3 = 8
```

```
Q: How many bits would a full color picture have of 100 * 50?
- 100 * 50 * 24 = 120000
```

#### 2️⃣ Vector

- more professional, more efficient when picture is not so detailed
- `svg`

- do not use pixel, use `area by area`/ `zone by zone`
- call the color just once, then call the length/size/measurements of the area that has that color
- `red(255.0.0)* 10 meters + white(255.255.255) * 2 meters`
- the picture tends to be more compressed
- 👍🏻 more efficient
- 👍🏻 when the area is uniform, no big transition of color, use vector
- ⭐️ big areas of same color(like football field, all green)
- ↔️ image with many color changes, use Raster(like a christimas tree with lights)
- if I make the picture bigger, zoom in, then just have to change the length/size/measurements
- do not get pixelized

- 👎🏻 however, as measuring device is more expensive,
- vector is only used for professional purposes

## 📌 Main Computing Principle

- 0: 0.5v
- 1: 5v

- If you have `n bits` to store 0s and 1s, you can have total of `2^n` combinations
- 1 bit: 2 combinations `0, 1`
- 2 bits: 4 combinations `00, 01, 10, 11`

## ✅ Audio

- Audio is vibration, need air to transmit
- microphone has a small surface to capture vibration
- microphone transforms the vibration to binary code
- extension for audio is `.wav`
- when compressed/summarized `.mp3`
- if `la, la, la, la`, `.mp3` summarizes sound and save `la * 4`
- ⭐️ `.mp3` does not lose sound, but just summarized
- `.mp3` is very compressed when there are uniform, repetitive sounds in the track
- if many different sounds, `.mp3` will not be so efficient

#### ☑️ Sampling Frequency(Hertz)

- how many times per second the computer pays attention to the microphone/vibration
- sampling frequency ⬆️ better sound quality, capture more details of the sound wave ⬆️
- sampling frequency ⬇️ cannot capture all the details of the sound ⬇️
- if frequency is `1Hz`, then listening `1 time/sec`
- if frequency is `1KHz`, then listening `1000times/sec`
- if frequency is `1MHz`, then listening `1000000 million times/sec`
- if frequency is `1GHz`, then listening `1000000000 thousand million times/sec`
- ⭐️ If you capture a sound with a high sampling frequency, will get more details of the sound

#### ☑️ Amplitudes(bits)

- number of all the different sounds you want to capture
- in an orchestra, you want to capture more instruments, need higher amplitude
- higher amplitude ⬇️ more variety of sounds ⬇️

- Q: If orchestra used 16 different sounds, how many bits would we need?
- need 4 bits
- Amplitude = 4

- Q: If orchestra used 80 different sounds, how many bits would we need?
- need 7 bits (2^7 = 128)
- Amplitude = 7

#### ☑️ Time(seconds)

- how long the music lasts, measured in seconds
- more time ⬆️ can save longer song ⬆️

#### ☑️ Stereo

- full stereo: use two sequences of bits(2bits) per ear, duplicate the sound
- left and right ear listen to the whole song
- need to multiply formula by 2

- mono stereo: one sequence of bit, divide sound in two
- left ear: background music, right ear: singer voice

#### ✔️ Audio Size

- size: `Hertz * A * t`

```
Q: How many bits do you need for an orchestra for a 4 minute song, with 300 amplitude, sampled at 2GHz?
- size: Hertz * A * t
- 2*10^9 * 9 * (4*60)
 = 2000000000 * 9 * 240` bits
```

## ✅ Video

- sequence of pictures + sound
- `.avi`, `.mov`
- compressed into `.mp4`
- however, `.mp4` suffered from forking
- forking: people started using another form of video `.wmv`, not compatible with `.mp4`

#### ☑️ FPS, Frames per second

- how many images video shows per second
- fps ⬆️ better quality of video ⬆️

#### ☑️ Prediction in video

- in video use prediction
- as some pictures are important,
- but other pictures are evident, so not as important
- use picture I, P, B

#### ✔️ Types of picture in video

- **Picture type I**: Important
- independent pictures, important pictures
- mandatory to record them independently

- **Picture type P**: Predicted
- predicted pictures
- can predict them, as it is very similar to the previous picture

- **Picture type B**: Bidirectional
- Bidirectional
- extra movement to make video transition more natural
- pictures used to improve transitions
- make video look softer

#### ✔️ Video size

- `picture size * fps * t + Audio * 2(stereo)`
- `HR * VR * D * fps * t` + `Hertz * A * t * 2`
- ⭐️ audio is added

```
Q: How many bits a 5 minute video have that has resolution of 1920\*1090 full color at 1000fps with stereo sound of 100 amplitudes sampled at a frequency of 25MHz?
- {(1920*1920 * 24) * 1000 * (5*60)} + {( 25 * 10^6)  * 7 * (5*60) * 2 bits}
```

- ⭐️ only **color depth** and **amplitude** has to be converted into bits

## ✅ File

- all the bits are stored in a unit called `file`
- `file`: set of bits with information

- `metadata`: extra information about the file
- ⭐️ metadata is stored in the Operating system
- Timestamp: `created_date`, `last_modified_date`

  - `owner of the file`
  - `size of the file`;lkj
  - `extension of the file`
  - `permissions over the file`, read/write/execute permissions, what you can do with the file
  - `access control`, who can access the file

- Linux keeps metadata very far from data itself, 👍🏻 safe from haking
- However, Windows keep metadata close to the data itself, not very safe
