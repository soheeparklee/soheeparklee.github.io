## ‚úÖ Linear Data Type

- output if proportional to input
- system follows principle of superpostiion
- (adding input = adding outputs)
- predictable
- linear equations

<br>

- **Additivity**:
  - two jobs then add two results üü∞ add two jobs and get one result
- **Homogeneity**:
  - all elements are the same type
  - make instuction bigger/smaller ‚û°Ô∏è result is also bigger/smaller

<br>

- `array`: has additivity
- `list`: has additivity
- `queue`: order is important in insertion, deletion ‚û°Ô∏è has homogeneity
- `stack`: order is important in insertion, deletion ‚û°Ô∏è has homogeneity

## ‚úÖ Non-Linear Data Type

- output is not directly proportional to input
- do not follow principle of superposition
- unpredictable

<br>

- `Binary Search Tree`
  - non linear bc `path` taken to find/insert/delete `depends on node value`
  - path depends on `comparision`
- `Graph`
  - no strict order of travel
  - flow depends on `edges and nodes`
