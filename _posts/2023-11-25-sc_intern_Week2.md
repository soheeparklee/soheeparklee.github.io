## ✅ This weeks achievements\_이번 주 목표 달성 여부

#### **What I learned\_알게된 점**

This week was about backend. I made a memo app where I could create, read, update and delete my memos.  
But this memo app was limited as I could only add memo on the server.  
So I also learned about using SQL, which is a relational database!  
I improved my carrot app by adding a backend and a server

#### **What I tried\_스스로 시도해본 것들**

When I was making my memo app, there was a difference between the data type that the backend was sending and frontend was recieving. I made int into a str by using `.toString()`. This solved the problem.

#### **Trouble Shooting\_해결 내용**

#### **What I should work on\_부족한 점**

con, cur is a difficult method. I didnt understand the meanings.

#### **Looking back\_회고**

Starting club activities was fun!

## 🍀 Next week goals\_다음 주 목표 설정

Start studying more Java and network.  
I will also learn about svelte and firebase!
