## ✅ NoSQL

> unrelational DB
> **not only** SQL

- can use query language depending on API/DB/query

- 👍🏻 scalability
- 👍🏻 availability
- 👍🏻 data is saved according to how application is used
- 👍🏻 need for data encoding ⬇️
- 👍🏻 cloud environment: no downtime
- 🛠️ used in in-time application
- 🛠️ **bigdata**

## 🆚 RDB

> RDB: Relational Database

✔️ **NoSQL**

- Data Modeling: more difficult than relational DB
- Scalability: ⬆️
- Relational: no relation
- Transaction: 👎🏻
- 👍🏻 more flexible
- 👍🏻 fast operation
- 👍🏻 big data

✔️ **RDB**

- Data Modeling: table ➕ `key-value` ➕ constraints
- Scalability:
- Relational: data based on relation
- Transaction: 👍🏻
- 👎🏻 big data
- 👎🏻 slower than NoSQL

## ❓ Why is NoSQL faster than RDB?

- NoSQL does not have constraints nor schema
- not structured DB

- thus, add, update, delete data is faster
- efficient in handling big data
- high scalability
- more flexible
