## ✅ Call by Value

> when method is called, memory is allocated <br>
> Call by Value copys the value of variable as method parameter <br>
> local value(does not change value within the method) <br>
>
> > case of java <br>
> > java variable has `the memory address where value is saved` as value <br>
> > orignial value is **not** changed <br>
> > but has to allocate new memory space when variable is used, 👎🏻 more memory usage <br>

## ✅ Call by Reference

> when method is called, reference of value <br>
> if variable value is changed within the method, original value is changed <br>
> C/C+ can use call by reference <br>
