## Algorithm ðŸ†š Data Structure

Data Structure: to save data according to rules and objective <br>
Algorithm: set of instructions to solve a problem using data <br>

## âœ… Conditions of a good Algorithm

1. Well defined input <br>
   - may or may not take input
2. Well defined output <br>
   - at least one output
3. Finite-ness <br>
   - algorithm must terminate after finite time
4. Clear and Unambiguous <br>
   - only one meaning
5. Feasible <br>
   - should be exectued with available sources
