## 📌 Types of Operating Systems based on technical specifications

- There are several types of OS depending on the asepct
- Define the technical specification of the OS

## ✅ Response Time

> how fast your OS responds <br>
> how long I should wait before the OS responds <br>

#### 1️⃣ Batch

> 🟰 Por lotes

- Batch OS does not interact w the customer
- and takes as much as it wants to do its job
- customer does not wait for the OS to finish its job
- no need for speed
- 👀 Whatsapp does an update every night at 2am, users do not wait for this

#### 2️⃣ Interactive OS

- OS that interacts w the user
- 🐇 Interactive OS aims to be fast
- When systems are interactive, each user needs a **time slot**
- to use time slot, we use **time sharing**

#### 3️⃣ Real time OS

- 🚀 time/response time is very very short
- responds **immediately**
- 👀 airport towers, military
- 🛠️ specific OS that is very expensive, used for professional uses
- normally an **automatic** OS that makes decisions
- 👀 if a plane is going to crash, the plane will not wait for the pilot to press a button, will make its own decision

## ✅ Number of users

#### 1️⃣ Mono user OS

> only one user at a time

- If you want another user, close the previous user
- 👁️ Windows is mono user, if you want to change user, need to logout, close session

#### 2️⃣ Multi user OS

> OS that can interact w **several** users at the **same** time w/o closing sessions

- 👀 Linux is multi-user
- In Linux, I am So Hee but I can make a file as Jose.

```
🤫 Problem of Linux
- Linux has lots of characteristics
- that are very good
- but very professional, more complicated
- So only professionals use more Linux, but normal users want easy things
```

## ✅ Number of Processors

#### 1️⃣ Mono Processor OS

- 🟰 mono core
- only has one processor

#### 2️⃣ Multi Processor OS

- means either multi core or has two CPUs
- can have more than one processors
- or a computer having two CPUs, but more difficult as two CPUs are more difficult to manage

## ✅ Number of tasks OS can do at the same time

#### 1️⃣ Mono tasking

- If an OS is `mono core` and `mono threading` ➡️ mono tasking
- 👀 In the whatsapp update OS, it is not doing anything but just updating, does not send/recieve messages

#### 2️⃣ Multi tasking

- can do several tasks at the same time
- If an OS is `mono core` and `multi threading` ➡️ multi tasking
- If an OS is `multi core` and `multi threading` ➡️ multi tasking

```
❓ What happens if OS is multi user and multi tasking
and two users want to interact with the same task

If the two users want to interact at the same time,
there cannot be a collision
👉🏻 called locking

💡 Locking: I am going to stop one user, then let the other user
then if this user finishes, the waiting user can work
👀 Shared documents uses locking, as one cannot write and the other cannot delete at the same time!
```

## ✅ Networking

#### 1️⃣ Centralized OS

- `Systema Operativa Monopuesto`
- OS is installed in one machine
- 👀 Windows 10

#### 2️⃣ Distributing OS

- `Systema Operativa Red`
- OS that is distributed over several machines
- OS uses resources of several machines
- 👀 Windows 7

## ❓ Analyze Windows 10

Analyze `Windows 10 OS` based on...

- following response time:
- following number of users:
- following number of processors:
- following number of tasks:
- following network:

- Microsoft windows 10 is hybrid
- Although in class we discussed windows is micro-kernel,
- but windows 10 is aiming towards becoming a hybrid model
