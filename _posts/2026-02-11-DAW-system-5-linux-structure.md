## ✅ Evolution and distros of Linux

- in linux, it is not called `version`
- called `evolution` and `distro`

## ✅ Hybrid OS

- Linux is a hybrid
- `kernel` of linux does important stuff + `extras(users servers)`
- extras are called users servers
- users servers can be deactivated

```
❓ Why would I deactivate users servers in linux?
- bc I need to save resources
```

#### ☑️ Hybrid system in Linux is circular

- not square ❌
- linux hybrid system is circular

- ✔️ **Kernel**
- 👍🏻 extra security level in Linux
- linux kernel is protected
- by an extra application called shell
- if the users want to execute smth
- the shell needs to give permission

- red: kernel
- gray: shell
- colorful: commands of user applications

- ✔️ **Linux Shell**
- surrouding the kernel

- ✔️ **User applications**

#### ✔️ **Multix**

- origin OS of Linux
- OS that was installed in a computer that was called `main frame`
- `multi`: multi, several users

```
⭐️ main frame: huge computer for multiple users
- not personal computers, for several users
- users are connected to the main frame
- through the console

- company named Bell Labs had the main frame
```

- two students wanted to use the `main frame` for using video games
- created a new OS, called `Unix`

#### ✔️ Unix

- as seen in the name, `u` stands for `unique`
- for one, unique user
- specialized in graphics
- they wanted to play video games

- 👎🏻 very expensive
- only the univerisities could afford `unix`

- `unix` becames popular
- one computer systems teacher decided to create a demo version of `unix`
- created a mini version, just for his class
- called `minix`

#### ✔️ Minix

- used for teaching `unix` in that class
- one student in the class to make the system free

#### ✔️ Linux

- the student name was linux
- created a free version of that `mini OS`

- the student decided to take the penguin, called Tux
- as a symbol of `linux`
- all the webpages that has the word `TUX` means official linux errors pages
- expert of Linux

#### ✔️ GNU

- a group of ppl thought computing should be free
- that group was called `GNU`
- `General Not Unix`
- means asking for free `unix`

- in every application you see a `gnu`(animal),
- you are indicating that,
- that application is free of charge

- 👉🏻 The official name is **GNU/LINUX**

## ✅ Names of Linux

- traditionally, new versions of linux
- have a name that shows identity of the new version

## ✅ Sign to use Linux

- although linux is free
- need to sign a contract, GPL

- ⭐️ **GPL**: General Public Licence
- you are signing
- you promise that you will not make profit of anything based on linux
- and if you create a new version of yours
- you can only asks for donations
- and if someone donates you, you need to tell what you will do with that donation

## ✅ Distro of Linux

- ✔️ **Gentoo**: para gente, customizable, flexible linux, you can change everything about this linux distro
- ✔️ **Debian**: very stable distro of linux
- ✔️ **Ubuntu**: very stable, fast, easy to use and install

- linux is using balancing
- official coaching tools for linux
- several aspects for taking into account for evaluating linux

- somme of them are not totally free
- they cannot charge for the kernel
- but they charge for utilities

## ✅ Evaluate Linux

- easiness of installation
- hardware needs
- desktop aspects
- management of documents
- if it is customizable
- if there is a good community support
- package: if you have to download many files, or you just have to download one
- cutting edge: digital barrier, is it difficult to understand?
- slow, fast, insecure
