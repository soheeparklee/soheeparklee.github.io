## ✅ DB Index

> to search faster in RDMS

- index a column in table(save as file)

  - do not need to full scan the whole table record
  - search index file(B+ Tree)
  - search MYI file

- When a table is created three files are made

  - FRM: table architecture
  - MYD: data
  - MYI: index info

- 👎🏻
  - `.mdb` file size increases
  - difficult to change one page concurrently
  - updating data, inserting or deleting record in an indexed field capability ⬇️
  - if frequent update of data, need to rewrite index
