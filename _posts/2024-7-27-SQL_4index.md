## ✅ DB Index

> to search faster in RDMS <br>
> enhance query speed <br>

- 👍🏻 data search faster
- 👍🏻 data sort faster
- 👍🏻 data update faster
- 👍🏻 efficient management of data

✔️ **index a column in table(save as file)**

- do not need to full scan the whole table record
- search index file(B+ Tree)
- search MYI file

✔️ **when index is created on a certain column**

- sort column data
- saved on seperate memory with data physical address
- save column value with physical address `key-value`

✔️ **When a table is created three files are made**

- `FRM`: table architecture
- `MYD`: data
- `MYI`: index info

👎🏻 **disadvantages**

- `.mdb` file size increases
- difficult to change one page concurrently
- updating data, inserting or deleting record in an indexed field capability ⬇️
- if frequent update of data, need to rewrite index

> **When to use Index?**
>
> > - column frequently used in `where` <br>
> > - foreign key column <br>
> > - column frequently used in `join` <br>
> > - data range is broad, but little repetition <br>

 <br>

> **When not to use Index?** <br>
>
> > column with high data repetition <br>
> > column with high DML <br>

## ✅ Index algorithm

✔️ **Hash Table**

- save `key-value`
- however, not frequently used in index
  - bc hash is optimized for `=`
  - in DB, need more `<`, `>`

✔️ **B+ Tree**
