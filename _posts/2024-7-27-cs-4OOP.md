## ☑️ Sequential Programming

- program runs by order
- unstructued programming
- 👎🏻 if need code from before, use **goto**
- need to pay attention to flow(in what order will this code be run), instead of code developemnt

## ☑️ Procedural Programming

- structured programming
- repreated codes are made into **method(procedure)**
- procedure: method that does not return
- 👎🏻 too abstract

## ✅ Obejct Oriented Programming

- 현실 세계를 프로그래밍 세계로 옮겨와 현실 세계의 사물들을 객체로 생각
- 객체의 특징, 기능을 뽑아 프로그래밍
- class has field, getter, setter
- to manage an object's **field** and **method** toegether

#### 👍🏻 Abstraction

```
- fish, cat, dog all fit in animal
- animal is abstraction
- get all common characteristics, into one object
```

> why use abstraction?
>
> > if tiger is added, need to develop just the new part for animal istead of developing all over again .

#### 👍🏻 Encapsulation

> if alternation happens, minimize impact on other codes <br>
> minimize coupling <br>
> minimize dependencies of independent objects <br>

- use private field

#### 👍🏻 Inheritence

> another type of encapulsation
> capsulize child class from public

#### 👍🏻 Polymorphism

> child class can override parent class method, and use it as it wants

## ✅ SOLID

> OOP 설계 원칙 <br>
> how to program object oriented <br>

#### 1. SRP

> Single Responsibility <br>
> class should have one responsibility <br>

- not to affect other codes

#### 2. OCP

> Open Closed Policy

- open for **expansion**, closed for **update**
- can update or change function, however do not change the code.

#### 3. LSP

> Liskov Substitution Principle

- object of a **superclass** should be **replaceable** with an object of a **subclass** without affecting the correctness or consistency of the program's behavior

#### 4. ISP

> Interface Segregation Principle

- interface should be seperate

#### 5. DIP

> Dependency Inversion Principle

- should depend on abstraction
- 추상화(인터페이스)에 의존해야 하며, 구체화(구현된 클래스)에 의존해서는 안된다.
