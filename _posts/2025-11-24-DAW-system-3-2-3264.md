## ✅ 32 or 64 can mean two things

> When we say `32 or 64`, we can be talking about two things

**1. The architecture of my motherboard**

- factory settings of the motherboard
- unchangeable

**2. Type of Operating System**

- the OS can be 32 or 64 bits
- changeable

## ✅ The architecture of my motherboard

**✔️ 32 bits architecture = x86**

- We say that my architecture is `32 bits` when all the buses transmit `32 bits` in **parallel**
- Parallel means: at the same time
- like a 32 lanes highway

- The technical name of 32 bits architecture is called **x86**
- following the name of the first 32 bits architecture computer, intel 8086

✔️ **64 bits architecture = x64**

- We say that my architecture is `64 bits` when all the buses transmit `64 bits` in **parallel**

- The technical name of 64 bits architecture is **x64 systems**
- Some ppl also called `x64` as `x86-64`, but this is wrong

- When you download an application,
- you need to know if your computer is a `x86` or `x64`
- from 2010, all computers are 64 bits

## ✅ How to know the architecture of your motherboard

1️⃣ First way:

- `windows + R` > `MSINFO 32`
- look for `system type(Tipo de sistema)`

- `windows + R` > `cmd` > systeminfo

- when you download, your tool should have the same architecture
- the tool of `CPU-Z for System Analysis and Monitoring Windows systems`
- this tool detects your architecture
