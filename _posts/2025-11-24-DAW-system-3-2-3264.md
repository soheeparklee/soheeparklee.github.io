## ✅ 32 or 64 can mean two things

> When we say `32 or 64`, we can be talking about two things

**1. The architecture of my motherboard**

- factory settings of the motherboard
- unchangeable
- architecture of a system cannot be modified. ❌

**2. Type of Operating System**

- the OS can be 32 or 64 bits
- changeable

## ✅ The architecture of my motherboard

#### ☑️ ** 32 bits architecture = x86**

- We say that my architecture is `32 bits` when all the buses transmit `32 bits` in **parallel**
- buses of the motherboard has 32 bits
- Parallel means: at the same time
- like a 32 lanes highway

- ✔️ **RAM in x86**
- If you have `x-86`, your RAM maximum would be `4GB`
- If the conections(bus) have 32 bits,
- you have `2 to the power to 32` positions on the RAM
- `2 to the power to 32` = 4GB of RAM
- ⚠️ If you insert more than 4GB, your RAM will not be read at all! 😱

- The technical name of 32 bits architecture is called **x86**
- following the name of the first 32 bits architecture computer, intel 8086

- these days personal computers use `x64`
- but many servers still keep the achitecture `x86`

#### ☑️ **64 bits architecture = x64**

- We say that my architecture is `64 bits` when all the buses transmit `64 bits` in **parallel**

- The technical name of 64 bits architecture is **x64 systems**
- Some ppl also called `x64` as `x86-64`, but recomment `x64`

- When you download an application,
- you need to know if your computer is a `x86` or `x64`
- from 2010, all computers are 64 bits

- ✔️ **RAM in x64**
- you have 64 bits for everything
- you have `2 to the power to 64` positions on the RAM
- `2 to the power to 64` = 16Exa of RAM

```
❓ Can a system with x86 read more than 4GB?
👉🏻 NO.

❓ I have a computer, when I insert more than 4GB, I have an error. WHy?
👉🏻 Bc I am using x86
```

## ✅ How to know the architecture of your motherboard

#### 1️⃣ First way:

- `windows + R` > `MSINFO 32`
- look for `system type(Tipo de sistema)`

- `windows + R` > `cmd` > systeminfo

- when you download, your tool should have the same architecture
- the tool of `CPU-Z for System Analysis and Monitoring Windows systems`
- this tool detects your architecture

#### 2️⃣ Second way:

- `systeminfo`
- capture the terminal

## ✅ Type of Operating system

- modifiable

#### ☑️ 32bits

- We say that OS has 32 bits if the Apps of the Harddisk(secondary memory) have a maximum of `4GB`

#### ☑️ 64bits

- We say that OS has 64 bits if the Apps of the Harddisk(secondary memory) can have a maximum of `16Exa Bytes`

## ✅ How to check my OS

#### 1️⃣ on terminal

- `windows key` + `R`
- type `cmd`
- in the terminal that appears, write `wmic os get osarchitecture`

#### 2️⃣ visually

- open `windows explorer`
- go to `this pc`
- double click on
- if you see two folders, your OS has `64bits`
  - one folder than ends in `x86`, it will be for files less than 4GB
  - and the other folder would be for bigger apps
- if you see one folder, your OS has `32bits`

```
❓ Can I have a windows 11 or 32 bits?
👉🏻 Yes you can. All OS have 32 and 64 bits versions, including windows 11
- so, you can choose.
```

- the bigger the architecture, bigger the OS,
- 64 bit versions are always better, faster, more efficient
