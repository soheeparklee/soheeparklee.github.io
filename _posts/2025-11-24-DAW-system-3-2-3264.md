## ✅ 32 or 64 can mean two things

> When we say `32 or 64`, we can be talking about two things

**1. The architecture of my motherboard**

- factory settings of the motherboard
- unchangeable
- architecture of a system cannot be modified. ❌

**2. Type of Operating System**

- the OS can be 32 or 64 bits
- changeable

## ✅ The architecture of my motherboard

#### ☑️ 32 bits architecture = x86

- We say that my architecture is `32 bits` when all the buses transmit `32 bits` in **parallel**
- buses of the motherboard has 32 bits
- Parallel means: at the same time
- like a 32 lanes highway

✔️ **RAM in x86**

- If you have `x-86`, your RAM maximum would be `<=4GB`
- If the conections(bus) have 32 bits,
- you have `2 to the power to 32` positions on the RAM
- `2 to the power to 32` = 4GB of RAM
- ends with 8F, `FFFFFFFF`
- NOT file size, RAM size would be 4GB ❌

- ⚠️ If you insert more than 4GB, your RAM will not be read at all! 😱

✔️ Name of 32 bits architecture, **x86**

- The technical name of 32 bits architecture is called **x86**
- following the name of the first 32 bits architecture computer, intel 8086

✔️ What uses the x86 motherboard system?

- these days personal computers use `x64`
- but many servers still keep the achitecture `x86`

#### ☑️ 64 bits architecture = x64

- We say that my architecture is `64 bits` when all the buses transmit `64 bits` in **parallel**

✔️ **Name of 64 bits, x64**

- The technical name of 64 bits architecture is **x64 systems**
- Some ppl also called `x64` as `x86-64`, but recomment `x64`

✔️ **Check before downloading**

- When you download an application,
- you need to know if your computer is a `x86` or `x64`
- from 2010, all computers are 64 bits

- ✔️ **RAM in x64**
- you have 64 bits for everything
- you have `2 to the power to 64` positions on the RAM
- `2 to the power to 64` = 16Exa of RAM
- end in 16F, `FFFFFFFFFFFFFF`
- this does not exist, but RAM would be 16Exa RAM

```
❓ Can a system with x86 read more than 4GB?
👉🏻 NO.

❓ I have a computer, when I install smth bigger than 4GB, I have an error. WHy?
👉🏻 Bc I my motherboard is using x86
```

## ✅ How to know the architecture of your motherboard

#### 1️⃣ First way: MSINFO 32

```
windows + R > MSINFO 32 > System Type(Tipo de sistema)
```

- when you download, your tool should have the same architecture
- the tool of `CPU-Z for System Analysis and Monitoring Windows systems`
- this tool detects your architecture

#### 2️⃣ Second way: systeminfo

```
Win+R > cmd > systeminfo
```

- `systeminfo`
- capture the terminal

## ✅ Type of Operating system

- modifiable
- applications inside the HDD

#### ☑️ 32bits

- We say that `OS has 32 bits` **if the Apps/Files of the Harddisk(secondary memory) have a maximum ofs**`4GB`
- apps, files will have max of 4GB, not the RAM ❌

#### ☑️ 64bits

- We say that OS has 64 bits if the **Apps of the Harddisk(secondary memory)** can have a maximum of `16Exa Bytes`

## ✅ How to check my OS

#### 1️⃣ on terminal: wmic os get osarchitecture

```
Win+R > cmd > wmic os get osarchitecture
```

- `windows key` + `R`
- type `cmd`
- in the terminal that appears, write `wmic os get osarchitecture`

#### 2️⃣ visually

```
You could also do the visual way: Open windows explorer > This PC (Este Equipo) Double Click C
```

- open `windows explorer`
- go to `this pc`
- double click on C
- if you see two folders, your OS has `64bits`
  - one folder than ends in `x86`, it will be for files less than 4GB
  - and the other folder would be for bigger apps
- if you see one folder, your OS has `32bits`

- ⭐️ Review
- in a `32bits OS`, you see only one program files
- in a `64bits OS`, you see two program files
  - program files: for bigger applications, bigger than 4GB
  - program files(x86): for files that are less or equals to than 4GB

```
❓ Can I have a windows 11 or 32 bits?
👉🏻 Yes you can. All OS have 32 and 64 bits versions, including windows 11
- so, you can choose.
```

- the bigger the architecture, bigger the OS,
- 64 bit versions are always better, faster, more efficient

```
❓Do we have all version, version 32 and version 64 of all OS?

- windows 8 had 32, 64 versions, windows 11 also have both versions...
- all OS have two versions
- do not think that 32 bit OS is old and bad, its just another version of OS
- and also, 64bit OS does not mean new and good, just choose the OS version that suits your computer.
```
