## AOP ðŸ†š BEAN

AOP is to put together expected **concerns**, allowing developers to focus more on the central business logic. Concerns would be such as throw, catch errors and exceptions.

On the other hand, Beans would be a set of conventions for **reusable** components. javabeans need an empty no args constructor. In order to insert a javabean, there are three methods, and the main method is to do it through constructor. A bean is serializable.

## API ðŸ†š Interface

API stands for Application Programming Interface, and allows more than two application softwares to communicate with each other. An API can have several interfaces.

Interface defines the methods the class should implement. Interfaces are a way to achieve abstraction in JAVA.
