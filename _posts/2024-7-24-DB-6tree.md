## ✅ Tree

> node ➕ edges

- a tree cannot have cycles(if there is cycle, then it is a graph)
- one unique way from root to a certain node
- if count of node is `n`, number of edges will be `n-1`
  👍🏻 easy to navigate and search data <br>

### ✔️ Binary Tree

> tree with maximum of two children node

    - complete binary trees ➡️ heap
    - balanced binary trees
    - degenerate, pathological binary trees
    - 👎🏻 if tree is not balanced, efficieny ⬇️

### ✔️ Ternary Tree

> tree with atmost three child nodes

    - left, mid, right nodes
