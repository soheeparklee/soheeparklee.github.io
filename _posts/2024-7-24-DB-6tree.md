## ✅ Tree

> node ➕ edges

- a tree cannot have cycles(if there is cycle, then it is a graph)
- one unique way from root to a certain node
- if count of node is `n`, number of edges will be `n-1`
- 👍🏻 easy to navigate and search data <br>

## ☑️ Binary Tree

> tree with maximum of two children node <br>

- complete binary trees ➡️ heap
- balanced binary trees
- degenerate, pathological binary trees
- 👎🏻 if tree is not balanced, efficieny ⬇️

## ☑️ Ternary Tree

> tree with atmost three child nodes <br>

- left, mid, right nodes

## 🆚 Graph

Graph: 👍🏻 길찾기 문제 <br>
<br>

Tree: <br>

- 그래프의 일종
- no cycle ❌
- has direction
- 👍🏻 데이터 찾기
- if not root node, all node has parent node
- maximum two child node
