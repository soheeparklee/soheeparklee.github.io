- these methods are for dividing the main memory to run **multi programming** <br>
- two techniques for organizing, allocating memory <br>

## ✅ Memory

1. Continuous memory <br>
2. Incontinuous memory <br>

## ✅ Paging

> used for incontinuous memory allocation <br>
> divide into small processes of **same** size <br>

- 운영 체제에서 외부 단편화 문제 해결 위해 사용(**external fragmentation**)
- 👍🏻 can use needed data as fast as possible

- In physical memory, `Process A` and `Process B` are not all together
- processes are not places continuously
- 👍🏻 no wasted space
- 👍🏻 Prevent external fragmentation

## ✅ Segmentation

> also used for incontinuous memory allocation <br>
> divide into small processes of **various** size <br>
