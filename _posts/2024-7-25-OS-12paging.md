- these methods are for dividing the main **memory** to run **multi programming** <br>
- two techniques for organizing, allocating memory <br>

## ✅ Memory

1. Continuous memory <br>
2. Incontinuous memory <br>

## ✅ Paging

> used for incontinuous memory allocation <br>
> divide into small processes of **same** size <br>

- 운영 체제에서 외부 단편화 문제 해결 위해 사용(**external fragmentation**)
- 👍🏻 can use needed data as fast as possible

- In physical memory, `Process A` and `Process B` are not all together
- processes are not places continuously
- 👍🏻 no wasted space
- 👍🏻 Prevent external fragmentation
- 👍🏻 used more frequently than segmentation(no holes, no external fragmentation)

- 👎🏻 less secure, difficult sharing than segmentation
- divide `code+data+stack` into same size
- areas can be mixed while dividing
- areas can be mixed while sharing

## ✅ Segmentation

> also used for incontinuous memory allocation <br>
> divide into small processes of **various** size <br>

- devide memory into logical unit called segment
- segments are various size
- allocate memory, change physical address into logical address
- 👍🏻 no internal segmentation,
- 👎🏻 but external segmentation can occur

- 👍🏻 better than paging for security, sharing
- segmentation adds read/write/execute authorization to table logically
- to configure bit is simple, sage
- divided flexibly, areas do not mix while sharing

- 👎🏻 various segment size
- more holes occur, more external segmentation

## ☑️ Internal Segmentation

> When `process < memory` <br>

- process is saved, but there is left memory
- 20MB is too small to save any other process,
- left

## ☑️ External Segmentation

> Also `process < memory`, but not **continuous** <br>

- memory to save process is more than enough
- but not `continuous`
- process cannot be allocated on memory
- 💊 compaction

## 💊 Compaction

> to solve external segmentation issue <br>
> make two seperated memory **continuous** <br>

## ✅ Fit 🟰 Memory allocation Algorithm

> allocate left memory to process <br>

### ✔️ First Fit

- allocate **first memory found to be available**

### ✔️ Best Fit

- allocate the most fitting memory
- smallest left space
- internal segmentation ⬇️

### ✔️ Worst Fit

- allocate the wost fitting memory

### ✔️ Next Fit

- begin search from the last allocated place
