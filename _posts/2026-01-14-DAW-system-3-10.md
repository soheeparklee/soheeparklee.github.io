## BIOS Legacy 🆚 BIOS UEFI

BIOS: Basic Input Output System

- to study the BIOS, we use VM
- bc if we just change the BIOS, we will not be able to show anything
- your computer will be booting

## 🆚 BIOS Legacy

1️⃣ **Does not have a GUI** ❌

- no `Graphic User Interface`
- sometime you need to use the keyboard, you cannot use the mouse
- 👎🏻 not very user frienly
- 👎🏻 sometimes complicated

2️⃣ **Stable BIOS**

- 👍🏻 But as `Bios Legacy` has a long history, it is well tested, robust

3️⃣ **Firmware**

- `Bios Legacy` is a firmware
- firmware: very basic software very attatched to hardware, already installed on the hardware that boots automatically

4️⃣ **EPROM**

- `Bios Legacy` is a EPROM: Electronically Programmable Read Only Memory
- Electronically Programmable: we print `0` and `1` inside the chip
- when you buy, the information is already inside
- so it is not updateable ❌
- Read Only: you can only read from BIOS Legacy

💡 **Dual BIOS**

- (⭐️ text question)
- `Bios Legacy`: Dual BIOS
- Dual BIOS: some computers have two chips, two BIOS
- and in one of them, keeps the factory settings
- In this case, updates could be possible
- and you can always format it

- So Dual BIOS is perfect for system professionals
- so they can always try several things,
- and if their computer breaks down,
- they can always go back/default

- some DUAL legacy BIOS might have extension for overclocking
- but only if they are dual

## 🆚 BIOS UEFI

**Unified Extensible Firmware Interface**

- Unify: global, structure of UEFI is the same world-wide
- Extensible: you can update it
- Firmware
- Interface

1️⃣ **UEFI has GUI** ⭕️

- has Graphic user interface
- user friendly
- visual controls
- you can use keyboard, mouse...

2️⃣ **Downloadable in a USB**

- If the chip dies
- you can download the firmware from the internet,
- put it in the USB
- then install it again
- but the USB will always have to be plugged in, so some computers put tape on the USB to stick to the computer

3️⃣ **Fast Booting**

- (⭐️ text question)
- If you have UEFI
- you can activate fast booting
- Fast booting: switch the computer on, without doing much tests/reviews
- just swtich the computer on, leave the test/review for later
- 👎🏻 some applications do not support fast booting, they cannot start with fast booting
- ➡️ so you might have to deactivate fast booting

4️⃣ **Secure Booting**

- (⭐️ text question)
- Secure Booting: only certified applications boot
- certified 🟰 signed 🟰 with a copy right
- 👍🏻 improve security
- 👎🏻 not all applications are certified
- for example, `linux` is not certified
- ➡️ so if you want a linux, you should deactivate secure booting

5️⃣ **UEFI is a Third-Party Extensions**

- first-party in a computer/system: user
- second-party in a computer/system: OS
- third-party in a computer: other companies
- so UEFI can have extensions from other companies, different from the manufacture
- 👀 `overclocking`
  - artificially increasing the clock speed of your computer
  - 👎🏻 risky, imagine your heart running faster!
  - you need extra refrigeration, need a better fan
  - 👍🏻 it can increase the speed of your computer
  - overclocking can be done with UEFI
  - by downloading applications from other companies
  - used for video games with VR

6️⃣ **UEFI is not that robust**

- has a shorter history than BIOS Legacy
- so not so much testing has been done
- Legacy has been here for 50 years, whereas UEFI has a history of 14~15 years

## ✅ Functions of BIOS

- both Legacy and UEFI

### ☑️ Four most important functions of the BIOS

#### 1️⃣ Change the Boot sequence of a computer

- By default, the order of booting is as following

  - (1) Harddisk: the computer looks for the OS in the HD
  - (2) Network: the computer can also search for OS through the network
  - (3) External memory: the computer looks for OS in the USB

- ☹️ **The problem of the default order**
- imagine you have `windows 7`, but you want to update to `windows 10`
- you download the `iso file` of the `windows 10`
- then you put the `iso file` inside the bootable USB
- in order put the iso file in the USB, use programs such as `RUFUS`, `UUI`, `LiLi`, `VENTOY`, `MediaCreationTool`

- After you introduce the USB
- but if you do not alter the boot sequence,
- your computer will always start with OS in the harddisk, which is `windows 7`
- ➡️ you need to enter the BIOS and set the USB as the first OS to boot
- ➡️ **place USB before the HD**
- then the computer will boot the OS in the USB first, so it will boot `windows 10`

- Then you can choose
- for the USB to override the HD
- or can create a dual booting system

#### 2️⃣ Activate or deactivate the POST

- POST: Power On Self Test
- way of booting a computer making sure that all the componenets are perfect
- go component by component to check if it is ok
- 👎🏻 very slow, as you need to check all the components

#### 3️⃣ Create RAID systems(distributed storage)

- RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks
- to have several harddisks interconnected
- one information is split among the HD
- write the information in none of the HD at the same time
- information is mixed among the several disks

#### 4️⃣ Activate or deactivate Virtualization(Virtual Machine)

- If you can work with VMs or not
- some BIOSs bring the VM deactivated
- then VMs will not work
- you need to activate the VM

## ✅ How to know if I have Legecy or UEFI?

> Win+R > MSINFO32 > Modo BIOS

- modo de bios:
- you can also see the `brand` and the `date` of the BIOS
- with this you can check the bday of the computer
- MSINFO32 was also used to see 32/64

## ✅ How do you enter your BIOS?

#### 1️⃣ How to enter BIOS 1

- when the computer is OFF
- switch the computer on
- then press `Esc`, `Supr`, `F1`, `F2`, `F10`, `F12`

  - ❓ why so many options: depends on the brand of the BIOS

- need to press the keys super fast, many many times
- before the active OS appears
- if the windows(active OS) start appearing, you are too late

- In laptops, if the key for entering your BIOS is `F1, F2, F10, F12`
- then you need to press it with the `Fn` key

#### 2️⃣ How to enter BIOS 2

- when you cannot switch your computer off
- when you are inside windows 10/11
- ⚠️ this technique is **only valid if you have a UEFI**

#### 3️⃣ What happens if we cannot access the BIOS?

- Why I cannot access the BIOS?
- (1) bc you have fast start activated
- you do not have time to press the keys
- 💊 deactivate the fast boot

- Why I cannot access the BIOS?
- (2) Sometimes your BIOS needs an emergency USB
- bc the BIOS is corrupted
