#### 1️⃣ Architecture system

#### 2️⃣ Harddisk capacity

- (you need to have the comply with the minimum capacity, but also the recommended capacity)

  - if Ubuntu 24 says that minimum is 20GB, but recommends 25GB
  - the extra recommended space is for updates
  - so always put recommended space
  - in windows the updates are called `service pack`
  - in linux, the updates are called `packages`

- recommended capacity is always **5GB** more than the minimum capacity
- 👀 windows say minimum 40GB
- so always install with 45GB!

#### 3️⃣ RAM

- need minimum RAM and recommended RAM
- Lubuntu(`light version of ubuntu`) has a minimum of 2GB of RAM, but recommends 4GB of RAM
- recommend to give the recommended RAM
- if you give more than the minimum RAM, you are more multitasking

- the recommended RAM is always **double** than the minimum RAM

```
❓ You have a recommended HD for updates. You have a recommded RAM for multitaksing
👉🏻 HD is +5GB, and RAM is double
```

#### 4️⃣ the clock frequency

- clock speed
- how many GHz your OS needs
- some OS needs a very fast clock speed

#### 5️⃣ GPU

- ⚠️ the GPU is not a graphics card(external)!
- GPU: the internal graphics processor of the CPU
- located inside the CPU
- many AI need GPU inside the CPU

#### 6️⃣ Install media

- Specific ways of installation

- some OS needs specific ways of installation
- 👀 some OS cannot be installed with USB, some need to be installed through a network
- If a OS is installed through network, it is called `unattended installation`

## ✅ Hardware specs/limits for OS

- Hardware specs to satisfy are called `Scafold`
- all features we saw, OS bits, harddisk, RAM, clock frequency, GPU, install media

## ✅ Apart from the scafold, there are things that make no sense

- multitasking of OS in monocore and monothreading CPU? NO.
- multitasking OS, do not buy them if you have a monothreading server. It will not work
