## ✅ Blocking I/O

> block user process during I/O <br>

1. Process(Thread) requests I/O in kernel <br>
2. When kernel is done, return value to process <br>

- when I/O is in process, user process(thread) has to wait
- waste resource

  - I/O does not use CPU

- If various client connecting server is made in blocking
  - if there is I/O
  - cannot stop client process
  - need to create each process thread for each client
  - if a lot of clients connect at once
  - 👎🏻 context switching between thread

## ✅ Non-Blocking I/O

> does not block user process during I/O <br>

1. User process calls `recvfrom` method <br>
   tell kernel process needs data from socket <br>
2. Kernel cannot return `recvfrom` immediately, so returns `EWOULDBLOCK` <br>
3. User process does its work <br>
4. if there is data on `recvfrom` for user, recives data from Buffer <br>
   > `recvfrom` is on the memory of kernel, thus faster retrival of data <br>
5. `recvfrom` will copy the data, and return to user <br>
