## ✅ Copyright

- when I want to get money from other ppl when they use my SW,
- I need to go to the national government `Ministerio de Intellectual Property`

- register, pay, then you get your copy right
- copy right in computing goes from aroung `10,000eu ~ 100,000 eu`

- if other ppl use your product, they will pay
- but the product is yours
- they will pay for using the product

- We ask for copyright if we trust our creation will make money
- and we always take a risk, bc we need to make initial investment

- copy right is never done on test versions ❌
- it is done on final versions that are stable, smth that has been used for some time
- ⏱️ DO NOT wait too much for making a copy right, bc somebody can copy

  - suggestion: wait just three months after final release

- 👀 Windows
- we have to pay to use windows

## ✅ Copyleft

- If you want to get a copy left,
- go to webpage `GNU official website`
- register, no payment needed, free-of-charge

- 👀 **Linux** is copy left
- we do not have to pay for using linux

- but you will have to accept **some terms** to use copy left
- 💡 **GPL** `General Public License`: some terms we have to accept to use the free SW
- when we commit to GPL, we are promising that we will use this SW, but we will never make benefits of this
- so if we make smth based on Linux, we cannot sell this product ❌

- 👍🏻 copyleft products are created for sharing, for becoming global

- 👀 **Opensource** is also copyleft
- in open source, you can also see the code
- if it is open source and you can see the code, you can modify the code
- and create variable versions, but you cannot sell as it is copy left

- If you want to sell it, you need to get your copy right, then it becomes yours

- But not a good idea to make my project `copy left` then `copy right`
- as others can copy my code while my project was `copy left`

- Some copy lefts have donations at the end
- This donation is legal if it perfectly described in the `GPL` what the company is going to do with it donation
- and donation cannot be used for personal benefit
- it must be used for product improvement
- if the company does not commit with their commitment, and use the donation for their personal benefit, they can be punished

## ✅ Creative Commons

- This SW is for improving society, it is for sharing
- always has a hiphen

- ✔️ **CC-BY: Attribution**
- you need to mention/name the creator every time you use the SW
- BY attribution
- it is a good practice to always credit the creator
- 🤑 you can make money with `CC-BY` product
- you can just thank the creator, and sell the product

- ✔️ **CC-NC: Non-Commercial**
- you can use the SW, but you cannot sell, cannot make money
- you cannot copy your product
- having `CC-NC` is a nice method for testing if your product will be successful it before making it copyright

```
If oneday you want to make your project copyright,
but for the testing time,
if you want to see if it is successful wo anyone copying
you can make it CC-NC
```

- ✔️ **CC-ND: No Derivatice Works**
- you can use SW, but do not change!
- 👀 medical articles/researches
- you can share medical article, but cannot modify information from a doctor

- ✔️ **CC-SA: Share As/Alike**
