> types of software

## 📌 Operating System

- software to help standard users manage/use the computer without interfering/thinking of hardware
- software between hardware and software works, and helps users use hardware
- interface between users(real world) and computer(machine world)
- manages/controls/administrator of my computer

- saved in secondary memory(HDD or SSD)

### ☑️ OS has four functions

#### 1️⃣ File management, gestion de archivos

- managed closed files only, saved in secondary memory
- as OS and closed files are both in secondary memory, this is an easy job for the OS

- ↔️ You can have a computer without HD, so File management is little important job of OS

- ➡️ FAT32, NTFS...

#### 2️⃣ RAM management 🟰 Memory management

- when file is opened, and uploaded on the RAM
- upload on RAM and called process
- ↔️ You cannot have a computer w/o RAM, super duper important job of OS

- ➡️ Segmentation, Paging

#### 3️⃣ Process Management

- how to distribute timing among the different processes
- ↔️ super duper important job of OS

#### 4️⃣ Interruptions management

- when processes run, and temperature becomes too hot, OS would interfere
- As I/O Manager

- ↔️ You can have a computer w/o peripherals, so Interruptions management is little important job of OS

#### 👉🏻 So in hybrid stucture of the OS...

- See 2.4 structure of OS

- That is the reason why in hybrid stucture of the OS,
- the **kernel** does two most important functions
  - RAM management
  - Process Management
- and the **user server** does the extra
  - File management
  - Interruptions management

## ✅ Levels of software

- All software can be divided into 4 different levels

- machine code
- 0 and 1s

#### 2️⃣ System/Base SW

- software that acts as an **interface** with a machine
- example: OS, Drivers

#### 3️⃣ Programming SW

[![Screenshot-2025-11-01-at-12-07-56.png](https://i.postimg.cc/htshGbjT/Screenshot-2025-11-01-at-12-07-56.png)](https://postimg.cc/RW3vstwZ)

- applications for programming
- example: IDE with GUIs, visual studio

#### 4️⃣ Application SW

- software of the users
- example: google maps

```
❓ How do you call the SW that acts as an interface?
- System/Base SW
```
