## ✅ Timeline of Operating Systems

- ✔️ **EXEC**
- appeared in '60s
- improved into `Microsoft` and `UNIX`

- ✔️ **MS-DOS**
- Microsoft Disk OS
- first OS created by Microsoft
- used commands
- not visual
- very technical, not for standard users

- ✔️ **Windows**
- Microsoft created OS that can reach standard users
- has easy-to-understand windows to run commands
- visual

- ✔️ **Windows 3.11**
- first digital barrier
- 💡 _digital barrier_: digital development that breaks society in two groups
- divided ppl into ppl with windows 3.11 and ppl without
- if you had windows 3.11, you were considered high-tech
- ppl without windows 3.11 were considered low level tech professional

- ✔️ **More Window OS**
- Windows 95, 98, 2000, Millenium
- Effect 2000
- With `2000 and Windows Millenium`, ppl started feeling that they are spending too much money on Microsoft
- bc ppl had to buy two OS in one year, as Microsoft was releasing two per year
- Windows vista: very visual, but very slow
- Windows XP: very good OS
- Windows 7: very bad version
- Windows 8: very bad version
- Windows 10: perfct
- Windows 11:

- Microsoft was releasing every year a new OS
- and collapsing the market with too many produts in a very short time
- they were trying to sell so much

- ↔️ In the meanwhile, UNIX appereared
- Unix improved into Linux
- Linux was free, more stable(no new version every year), not changing for a long time
- So technician changed to Linux, while standard public stayed w Windows

## 💡 Tech rules

💡 **Rule number one.**

- Technicians should NOT create digital barriers
