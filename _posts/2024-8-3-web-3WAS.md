## ‚úÖ Web Server

> hardware: computer where web server is installed <br>
> software: recieve HTTP request from client, response **static** page <br>

- based on HTTP protocol
- when client request, provide **static** content
- send request for dynamic page to WAS

- provive **static** page
- static page

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - image
  - file
  - contents that immediate response is possible

- Apache
- Nginx
- IIS

## ‚úÖ WAS

> Web Application Server <br>
> Web server ‚ûï **web container** <br>
> üü∞ **sevlet container** <br>
> provide **dynamic pages that require DB searching, logics** <br>

- based on HTTP protocol

- **container**: software that can run `JSP`, `servlet`

- connect to **DB**
- for **dynamic** pages
- more focused on DB, logics

- JSP
- Servlet
- Tomcat
- JBoss

## Web server üÜö WAS

‚ùì **why divide Web server and WAS?** <br>

- web server: simpler static page <br>
- WAS: more complex DB connection, logics, dynamic page <br>

‚ùì **Why not use just WAS for static pages as well?** <br>
<br>
WAS can provide static pages as well<br>
However, use web servers as well because...<br>
<br>

**1. Prevent server overflow**

- divide `WAS` and `web server` to prevent server overflow
- `WAS`: DB search, logic
- `web server`: simple static page
- If `WAS` also has to provide static pages, more overflow

**2. Security**

- use web server for SSL encrpytion

**3. Several WAS**

- can connect to several WAS
- and use web server for load balancing
- provide availability

**4. Several web application services**

- can use PHP, JAVA application in one server
