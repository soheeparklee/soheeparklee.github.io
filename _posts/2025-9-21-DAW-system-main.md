## ‚úÖ System

> **set of connected elements**, with the purpose of **managing information automatically**

- not necessarily electrical ‚ùå
- first ever copmuter was an `Abacus`

## ‚úÖ Electricity

> a **current** that gives energy tot he computer <br>

- for a regular computer, it is an alternate current
- `220v` is the necessary voltage
- needs to be transformed into a **lower level** in order to enter the computer

## ‚úÖ Power supply

> the device to lower the electricity level

- transform the wave into ‚û°Ô∏è square wave
- top value: `1`
  - value of an element is `1` if the voltage in that element is high
  - average of `5v`
- lower value: `0`
  - value of element is `0` is the voltage is low
  - average of `0.5v`
- unplugged: `0v`
- and there is no intermediate value.
- üëâüèª Thus, computer works in binary

## ‚úÖ Microcomputing system

> computing system that works in binary with a power supply of values between `0.5v` and `5v`

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Condensators**
- Internally, information is stored in chips called condensators
- condensators store the voltage

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Transistors**
- 3 pins
- distribute the voltage stored in condensators to other elements
- or block the voltage from other elements

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Integrated circuit**
- place the transitors next to each other
- make the computer smaller

- ‚úîÔ∏è **GLSI computer**
- Giga Large Scale of Integration
- maximum integration
- ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì limit is a matter of the temperature ‚≠ïÔ∏è, not of dimensions ‚ùå
- when we have a GLSI computer, we are talking about the _micro processors_

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Micro processors**
- the brain of the computer made by transistors at the maximum scale of integration called a GLSI

## üí° How to solve the problem of temperature

> we need to cool the system

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ use dissipator
- take the heat out of the componenets
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ use a fan
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ use a heatsink
- like a corridor
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ liquid refrigeration
- use liquid to refresh the PC
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ nitrogen refrigeration
- the most powerful refrigeration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è however, might destroy some elements of the computer

- ‚ùå Quantic computers are not in the market bc they are too powerful
- thus release too much heat
- that we cannot cool it down

## ‚úÖ Code

> dictionary to understand `0s` and `1s`

- when we transmit `0s` and `1s`, we are transmitting a **code**
- networking: connecting computers in a network
- in order to network, we need a `dictionary` that transforms the sequence of `0s` and `1s` into smth human-readable
- ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì the code is the `dictionary` that helps humans translate binary into human language, and visa versa.

## ‚úÖ Coding

> coding: transform reality ‚û°Ô∏è binary <br>
> decoding: transform binary ‚û°Ô∏è reality <br>

## ‚úÖ Codec

- formed by the coder and the decoder

- ‚úîÔ∏è **audio codec**: binary ‚û°Ô∏è sound
- located in the sound card

- ‚úîÔ∏è **video codec**: binary ‚û°Ô∏è video/images
- located in the graphics card

- ‚úîÔ∏è **text codec**: binary ‚û°Ô∏è text
- located in micro processor
- modern keyboards also help with text codec

## ‚úÖ Driver

> program that installs new codecs and other elements, <br>
> either brand new or better ones into the computer <br>

- Installing a driver improves the capability of a computer
