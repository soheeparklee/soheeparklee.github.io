## ✅ Spanning Tree

> all nodes are connected to be part of tree <br>
> undirected graph <br>

## ✅ Spanning Tree Algorithm

> When there are several ways to reach a switch, bridge, <br>
> looping occurs <br>
> spanning tree algorithm is to prevent this looping <br>

## ✅ Minimum Spanning Tree

> type of spanning tree(1️⃣ all nodes are connected) <br>
> spanning tree that 2️⃣ has the minimum weight among all the possible spanning trees <br>
> spanning tree that has minimum weight possible <br>
> 그래프 안에서 1️⃣ 모든 노드를 연결하면서, 2️⃣ 가중치 합이 최소인 트리 <br>

- used to find way to connect all nodes with minimum weight

- Kruskal’s Algorithm: add edges to growing spanning tree
- Prim’s Algorithm: add vertext to growing spanning tree
