## ✅ Linux

- file system: `ext2, 3, 4`

## ✅ Rules of files in linux

#### 1️⃣ Files do not have extensions

- unless, you want to add an extension on purpose
- if you add an extension
- it becomes part of the name
- `patata.txt`
- name: `patata`, extension: `txt` ❌
- this is not a text file named patata ❌
- name: `patata.txt`
- this is a file that has name patata.txt without extension

#### 2️⃣ Metadata of the file are

✔️ **What is metadata?**

- size of the file
- owner of the file
- date and time of creation
- date and time of last modified
- permissions: read/write/execute 👀 `sohee` can only read
  - what the person can do
- access control: who can do things with that file, users 👀 `root`, `sohee`
  - the users
- location: where the file is
- timestamps: modifications of the file, modification dates
- pointer to the file

✔️ **Inodes table**

- Where is the metadata?
- all the metadata is separated from the file itself
- inside the inodes table
- **inodes table**: saves metadata of the file
- inodes table is inside the `OS in RAM`
- 🆚 whereas the file iteslf will be stored in `Harddisk`

✔️ **inside the Inodes table**

- inside the table, there is a identifier **inode number**

✔️ **How to read the file**

- find the inode number
- go to the OS in RAM
- find the metadata of the file
- go to the harddisk and open the file

✔️ **SWAP in Linux**

- everytime something is modified in the file
- the OS in RAM is disturbed
- so the RAM is collapsed, exhausted
- 💊 create SWAP partition
- that is why in linux, create the SWAP partition
- nowadays, if you forget to add the SWAP partition for Linux
- linux will automatically create a file called `SWAP file` in the `kernel`
- `SWAP file` is dynamic, changes according to your needs
- 👎🏻 so maybe when you need it, there is no space
- 💊 create the SWAP partition for linux
- 🆚 in windows, metadata is a header next to the file
- that is why in windows, SWAp is not necessary

## ✅ Tree in linux

- `cd`: for entering a branch

✔️ **How to name a directory/branch**

#### 1️⃣ **absolute path**

- getting to that directory starting by the root of the tree
- so it always starts with `/`
- bc you start with the root

- 👀 to go to `x11` in absolute path
- `/usr/X11R6/lib/x11`

- 🛠️ if you want to reach directories close to root, use absolute

#### 2️⃣ **relative path**

- getting to that directory starting from where I am
- recommended to start relative path with `./`
- `./` means where I am now
- but `./` is optional

- 👀 If I am in `usr`
- `./X11R6/lib/x11`
- `X11R6/lib/x11` is also possible

- 🛠️ if you want to reach directories close to yourself, use relative
- 🛠️ use the path that is better to your performance

✔️ **Four standard symbols in linux**

[![Screenshot-2026-03-02-at-17-36-38.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qRB3bYmF/Screenshot-2026-03-02-at-17-36-38.png)](https://postimg.cc/bGMrd6f0)

- `./`: where I am now
- `..`: reach my parent branch, the branch I come from, one step down in the tree
  - 👀 If I am in `x11`, and I want to go to `usr`, do `../../..` or `./../../..`
- `~`: `/home/personal`
- `/`: root

## ✅ Hardlink

- not a copy of the file, not a backup ❌
- one file with two names
- so even if we delete one name, we can still access the file with the other name
- if all names are deleted, the access to the file will be lost

✔️ **We can create a hard link**

- hard link
- `@` = `/mnt/dvd`
- when we associate a path to a symbol
- hardlink: a different name for the same thing
- an extra name of smth
- we can create hardlinks for anything

```
Cesar is called cesar and borja
create a hard link to cesar ➡️ borja
```

- 👀 `/`: hardlink for the root
- 👀 `~`: hardlink for `/home/shpl`
- 👀 `.`: hardlink for all directories I have visited
- 👀 `..`: hardlink for all the directories that have children

- 🆚 hard links only exist in linux
- so in linux, one file can have 20 names!

```
- There is a file with two names
- you move one of those names to a hidden place
- and somebody deletes the other name,
- did the file disappear?
- No, you can still access it from the hidden name

- 👍🏻 when we create a hardlink
- we are protecting the file
- bc even if somebody deletes the file
- I can access it with the other name

```

✔️ **How to delete a file forever in Linux**

- The only way of deleting the file forever in linux
- is to delete all hardlinks

```
❓ When can you recover the deleted file?

- when you had a hardlink to that file
- 👍🏻 so you can recover deleted files
- by finding hardlinks in linux
```

✔️ **One file has one inode number**

- all the hardlink of a file
- have the same inode number
- as the file is the same

- one file can have several hardlinks
- one file can have one inode number

```
❓ How to recover files in Linux?
- find pieces of the file in harddisk with inode number
- get the hardlink of the file
- then with the hardlink access the file

❓ How to recover files in harddisk?
- finding in the harddisk with same inode number
```

- create wierd hardlinks
- and moving them to other directories
- protect the files
- 👀 put passwords in music directory

```
❓ Two ways of protecting a branch in Linux

1. visit the file
- bc then the file will have hardlink . and the filename
- that is why linux visits all the branches when it boots

2. create sub-branch inside the branch
- that branch becomes parent
- so will also have hardlink ..
- enter the directory and create empty files inside
```

✔️ **When the branch is deleted, hardlinks stay**

- If you remove the branch `lib`
- but the branch `lib` had sub directories `x11`
- but to get to `x11`, you still have to go through `..`
- even if you delete parent directory,
- the hard link of sub directory will not change!

✔️ **In Linux, directory is the same as file**

- hardlinks can be created to directories and files
- directory is a file with a type `directory`
- directory means container of other things

## ✅ Soft link

- quick access to a data, 바로가기
- also called `symbolic link` in linux
- 👉🏻 a direct access to a hard link
- like an `direct access 바로가기` in windows

- sometimes, the soft links are moved to other branches of the tree
- to make the files accessible
- create a soft link and place it close to you

[![Screenshot-2026-03-04-at-15-27-27.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MHYgBSxM/Screenshot-2026-03-04-at-15-27-27.png)](https://postimg.cc/Cnzvy9RS)

- goal of soft link is making a **easy access** for you, create `바로가기`, purpose is **speed**
- 🆚 goal of hard link is **protecting** the file, hiding one name so you can always access the file even if another person deletes it

- if I delete one hardlink, no problem, you have another name to access the file
- if I delete one softlink, you are just deleting one of many accesses the file

- ❓ If I delete the hardlink that the soft link is pointing to?
- the real access to the file is hardlink
- and there is only one hardlink
- the file is deleted forever
- the softlink will be pointing to nothing
- then we have a broken link

#### ✔️ **Broken link**

[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Qtd7DgCN/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/KKCjrMtC)

- broken link: direct access(`soft link`) that is not useful anymore, bc they point to null

## ✅ Commands structure in linux

- `command name` ➕ `  ` ➕ `[options]`(optional) ➕ `  ` + `[arguments]`(optional)
- inside `[]` is optional

- 👀 `history`
- command with no options, no arguments

- 👀 `cal -m april`
- command: cal
- option: -m
- argument: april
- show me only the month(modifier) of april(argument)

#### ☑️ **options**

- modifier of the command

✔️ **Two ways of writing options**

- 1️⃣ `start with -` : original options that come from unix
- we are more used to original options from the 1980s
- tend to be shorteer
- 👀 `cal -m april`

- 2️⃣ `start with --`: modern linux options
- less ppl use the new options
- also called `pure linux`
- tend to be longer
- 👀 `cal --month april`

#### ☑️ **argument**

- purpose, destination of the command
- goal of the command
- to which thing you want to apply the command to

## ✅ Standard commands
- international command
