- These requirements are mandatory for Windows 10 in the the RM
- if we do it in a VM, VM should comply these requirements.

## ✅ For windows 10 we need...

#### ☑️ **Microprocessor, clock**

- 32 or 64 bits, speed > GHz

#### ☑️ **RAM**

- ⭐️ in systems, we say `Windows 10 is  1 2 4 system`
- 1GB would work for 32 bits
- 2GB would work for 64 bits
- 4GB is recommended

#### ☑️ **Cores**

- recommendable 2 real cores

#### ☑️ **Harddisk free space**

- 1️⃣ ⭐️ we say `Windows 10 is 16 20 +5`
- 16GB minimum if you want 32 bits
- 20GB minimum if you want 64 bits

- 2️⃣ + 5GB in whatever situation is recommended, for updates
- so, for 32 bits `16+5`
- for 64 bits `20+5`

- 3️⃣ and if you want to keep previous files, files from past versions
- round up to `10's`
- so, for 32 bits `21GB` ➡️ `30GB`
- for 64 bits `25GB` ➡️ `30GB`
- 👥 So many ppl say `windows 10 need 30GB, 30GB, 30GB....`

- ❓ Why do you do +5?
- for updates
- ❓ Why do you round up the HD?
- for keeping previous files

#### ☑️ Graphics card with Direct X and WDDM

✔️ **Direct X**

- Direct X: needs an API called Direct X
- 🛠️ used for multimedia

```
- API: programming interface
- program to use for programming other things
```

```
❓ Why does error `Direct X missing`
- can I boot windows?
- yes

- can I play video, music?
- no, cannot play multimedia
```

- 💊 You can download `Direct X` API and install it

❓ What if I do not have permission to install `Direct X`?

- then you cannot watch videos

✔️ **WDDM**

- Windows Display Driver Mode
- for better graphic performance

#### ☑️ Minimum resolutin

- VGA
- in VMs, windows can run with `VGA`
- windows can work with low resolution
- `800x600 pixels`

#### ☑️ Recommendable

- 2️⃣ connection to internet is recommendable for downloading Windows 10
