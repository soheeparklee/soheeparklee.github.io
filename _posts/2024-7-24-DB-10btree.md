## âœ… B Tree

> self-balancing tree <br>
> all leaf nodes are at the same level <br>
> can have more children than binary tree <br>

### ðŸ’¡ Applications

- databases to store indexes for efficient searching, retrival
- DNS servers: store domain names
- File System

### ðŸ’¡ Rules

- Balanced: all leaf nodes are at the same level
  - time to access data remains constant
- Self-balancing: as new data is inserted, deleted, tree automatically adjusts to maintain balance
- Multiple keys per node
- Ordered: nodes should be sorted
- number of keys `n`, then number of children node must be `n+1`
- root node should have min 2 child nodes
- other nodes should have more than M/2 nodes
- same distance to outer node
- no duplication of node

## âœ… B+ Tree

> data pointers are stored only at the leaf nodes of the tree

- stored as index node + leaf node
- leaf node is connected, allowing search efficiency
