## ✅ Proxy

> intermediary between client and server <br>
> connect two or more applications using same protocol <br>

- HTTP proxy can function both as `server` and `client`
- Proxy recives HTTP client request ➡️ Proxy responds like `server`
- Proxy can send request to server ➡️ Proxy can act like `client`

- has own IP address
- user ➡️ send request on internet ➡️ routed to proxy

## ✅ Public, Private Proxy

✔️ **Public Proxy**

- proxy that can be used by multiple users
- centralized management
- most proxies are public
- 👍🏻 cost effective
- 👍🏻 for cache proxies, more users ⬆️ more common requests ⬆️ more efficient ⬆️

✔️ **Private Proxy**

- proxy is dedicated exclusively to one client at a time
- can be used by only one user
- 👍🏻 increased security, as you are the only user, less concern about your information being compromised
- 👍🏻 one user can take full advantage of speed

## ✅ Functions of Proxy

- **Request forwarding**

- **Security**: act like firewall(detect virus)

- **Caching**: save frequently requested resources in proxy cache
  👍🏻 bandwidth saving, improved speed <br>

- **Load balancing**

- **SSL termination**

- **Filtering**: control internet usage <br>
  ・ 어린이에게 성인 콘텐츠 차단 위해 필터링 프락시 사용 <br>

- **Access control**: 웹 서버, 웹 리소스에 대한 클라이언트 별 접근 제한
  ・ 클라이언트 1은 접근하게 해주고 <br>
  ・ 클라리언트 2는 접근 못하게 하고 <br>
  ・ 클라이언트 3은 접근하기 전 비밀번호 요구 <br>

- **Surrogate**: some proxies act like `web servers`

・ also known as `reverse proxy` or `server accelerator` <br>
・ Surrogate proxies reviece request like web servers <br>
・ but does not hold data itself <br>
・ so communicates with other servers to find response <br>
👍🏻 improve slow web server response for shared content <br>

- **Contents router**:
  ・ send request to specific web server like a contents router <br>
  ・ example: A paid for faster service, and B didnt <br>
  ・ content router would send A to cache(faster), but send B to original server <br>
  ・ example: If C paid for filtering service, allow HTTP request to pass filtering proxy <br>

- **Transcoder**
  ・ **Transcoding**: chaning data presentation for user <br>
  ・ Transcoder proxy: change body content format before sending it to client <br>
  ・ example: change GIF to JPG, change image size <br>
  ・ compress text file, smaller text size for mobile environment <br>
  ・ also translation into another language for foreign user <br>

- **Anoymizer**: encrypt HTTP message to identify client
  ・ privacy ⬆️ security ⬆️ anomaly ⬆️ <br>
  ・ change user IP address and other identifying information <br>
  ・ delete `computer info`, `OS info` from `User-Agent header` <br>
  ・ delete `FROM header` to protect user email address <br>
  ・ delete `Referer header` <br>
  ・ delete `cookie header` to hide profile information <br>

## ✅ Forward Proxy

> exit point for subnet users seeking to connect with resources outside their private network

- send `client request` to `server` on behalf of client
- sit between `client and internet`
- handle **outbound traffic** from client to internet

- forward proxy server can cache client request
- protect client privacy
- can send client request to server **anonymously**

  - server can know only proxy server IP address
  - server cannot know client IP address

- content filtering
- access control
- bandwidth optimization

## ✅ Reverse Proxy

> entry point for external systems to access resources within private subnet

- send `server response` to `client`
- sit between `client and server`
- manage **inbound trafffic** from internet to server

- reverse proxy server can cache client response
- protect server performance

  - client will think of reverse proxy as original server
  - client sends request to reverse proxy server

- load balancing
- compression: compress outgoing content to reduce bandwidth, speed up data transfer
- authentication, single sign on

## 📌 Gateway

> protocol translation if client and server communicates in **different** protocol
> act like gatekeepers <br>

- Proxy: connect two or more applications using **same** protocol
- Gateway: connect two or more applications using **different** protocol

## 📌 VPN proxy

- Virtual Private Network is a particular implementation of a proxy serer
- proxy: handle network traffic
- VPN: encrypt the transmitted data
