## âœ… Priority Queue

> each data has priority.
> the data with priority will dequeue first.
> elements are retrieved based on their priority

## âœ… Heap

> made for **priority queue** <br>
> complete binary tree data structure <br>

- for every node, value of its children is less/greater than its own value

#### ðŸ’¡ How to define

- array

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

        minHeap.add(10);
        minHeap.add(20);
        minHeap.add(15);
    }
```

#### ðŸ’¡ appllications

- priority queue
- heap sort: sort an array in ascending, descending order
- Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm

## ðŸ†š binary search tree

- heap allows nodes to be repeated
- binary search tree does not allow repetition of nodes

## ðŸ’¡ Reference
