## ✅ Process Management

> manage multiple process by scheduling <br>

- in order for Process Management, CPU needs to know which process is who ➡️ Process Meatadata
- `Process Metadata`
  - processID
  - process state
  - process priority
  - CPU registers
  - Owner
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
- when process is created, `Process Metadata` is saved on PCB

## ✅ PCB

> Process Control Block <br>
> save process matadata <br>
> one PCB has information of one process <br>

```T
1. Program run
2. Process created
3. Process Address Space
    - code
    - data
    - stack
4. metadata of this process saved on PCB
```

> Why need PCB?
>
> > in CPU, processes are run in order <br>
> > process context, state is considered <br>
> > when interrupt occurs, process wait/ other process run <br> > > **save process that is waiting to be run on PCB** <br>

> How is PCB managed?
>
> > linked list <br>
> > PCB List Head + connect new PCB <br>
> > connected with address <br>
> > easy to insert, delete <br>

## ✅ Context Switching

> when running process is changed, change CPU register information
> save process info that was running on PCB, and save new process info from PCB and update CPU register

> When does Context Switching occur?
>
> > when there is interrupt <br>
> > consumed all CPU usage time <br>
> > process needs to wait for input/output <br>
> > basically, when CPU has to **change** the process that is running <br>
