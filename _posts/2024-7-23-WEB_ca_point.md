## ✅ Fixed Point

```T
-3.141592 = (-) + (3) + (0.141592) need three parts
```

> representation of real data type for a number that has **fixed** number of digits after radix point
> <br>

👍🏻 no complicated logic<br>
👍🏻 fixed accuracy<br>
👎🏻 represent limited range of values<br>
👎🏻 only can represent small number set<br>
👎🏻 less flexible<br>

## ✅ Floating Point

> formulaic representation of real numbers as an **apporoximation** as to support trade off between range and precision
> <br>

👍🏻 possible to represent large number set<br>
👎🏻 slower, lower performance<br>
👎🏻 accuracy varies<br>
👎🏻 complex logic<br>
