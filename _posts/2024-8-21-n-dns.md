## ✅ Domain Name

- **which computer** on network?
- correspond to `IP address`
- since `IP address` is too long to memorize, use `Domain Name` instead for humans
- In order to access a web site, need to get `IP address` with `Domain Name` from `Domain Name System`

For `IP address` and `Domain Name`, read this <https://soheeparklee.github.io/posts/n-4socketprogramming/> <br>

## ✅ Domain Name System

- DNS is a **distributed database** consisted of DNS servers in **hierarchy**

- application layer(layer 7)
- operates on UDP, port 53
- System to convert `Domain Name` to `IP address`
- can correspond several `IP address` to one `Domain Name`

> **What is the benefit of DNS being a hierarchical, distributed database?** <br>
>
> > DNS is used all around the world by many hosts <br>
> > by being distributed, more effective, scalable. <br>

## 📌 Domain Name System Operation

1. Type URI `www.google.com/index/html` on browser <br>
2. Browser will get `host name` `www.google.com` from URI, send to `DNS client` <br>
3. `DNS client` sends `host name` to `DNS server` <br>
4. `DNS server` responds `IP address` of `host name` to `DNS client` <br>
5. When browser recieves `IP address` from DNS, reset TCP connection to that `IP address` and `port 80` of that `IP address` to HTTP server process <br>

**✔️ DNS recursor**

- _recursive resolver_
- server that responds to DNS query
- ask another DNS server for IP address
- local DNS server

**✔️ Root-Level DNS Server**

- name server for root zone
- classified from A to M
- more than 400 root-level DNS servers on internet

**✔️ Top-Level DNS Server**

- high-level DNS server
- such as `.com`, `.org`, `net`, `edu`
- from `www.google.com`, TLD server for the `.com` will respond
- national domains
- such as `.kr`, `.uk`, `.jp`

**✔️ Authoritative name server**

- organization, company domains
- final stop for DNS query
- authoritative name server has the DNS record for the request

**✔️ Local DNS server**

- operate as _recursive resolver_
- is not strictly part of DNS layer, but it is in the center of DNS structure
- ISP has local DNS
- ISP use local DNS to respond to host with IP address
- when host requests for DNS, requested to DNS server as proxy

## 📌 Types of DNS Service

**✔️ Recursive DNS resolver**

- DNS recursor
- DNS server that responds to DNS query
- asks for the authoritative name server

**✔️ Authoritative DNS server**

- server to store DNS request
- if requested for IP address, doesnt ask any other server
- Authoritative name server is the final authority of IP address

## 📌 DNS queries

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 at 20 35 30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2fe7110-1a74-4653-bd2d-ca320ab75a7b)

**✔️ Non-recursive Query**

- DNS server is expected to return IP address from own local cache or database
- However, if the DNS server cannot find IP address, it will return `empty response`.

**✔️ Recursive Query**

- `DNS client(local DNS server)` asks **DNS resolver(ISP's DNS server)** to find IP address on its behalf
- **DNS resolver** communicates with other DNS servers to hunt down an IP address and return it to the client
- DNS resolver is responsible for finding IP address

- DNS resolver ask root name server
- DNS resolver asks TLD name server
- DNS resolver asks authoritative name server

- DNS resolver asks again and again ➡️ recursive
- local DNS server
- 재귀적

**✔️ Iterative Query**

- DNS resolver asks DNS server again and again in sequence for best answer

- DNS resolver ask root DNS server for IP address
- 😟root DNS server doesnt know.
- ➡️ return TLD name server address(best answer root DNS server has)
- ask TLD name server
- 😟 TLD name server doesnt know.
- ➡️ ask for authoritative name server address
- ask authoritative name server...

- continue iterative process until finding IP address, or timeout
- Root, TLD server
- 반복적

## 📌 DNS Record

> Information in a database that links a URL to an IP address <br>
> consists of DNS statements(series of text file) <br>

- A record: contain IPv4 address of the domain
- AAAA record: contain IPv4 address of the domain
- CNAME record: forward one domain or subdomain to another
- MX record: forward email to email servers
- TXT record: allow administrators to store text nodes in records
- NS record: store nameservers for a DNS entry

## 📌 DNS Cache

- repository of domain names and IP addresses saved on device
- so does not have to ask for IP address for a frequently visited site

- 👍🏻 speed up DNS request
- 👍🏻 reduce bandwidth

## 💡 DNS and UDP

> **Why does DNS use UDP?** <br>
>
> > 1. DNS priorities speed than reliability <br>
> >    DNS servers dont have to keep connections <br>
> > 2. To serve more clients <br>
> >    DNS requests are generally very small, and can fit well within UDP segments <br>

<br>

> How can DNS improve reliability? <br>
>
> > By adding timeout, resend at the application layer <br>

## 📌 How DNS functions

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 at 20 38 12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a040f36b-0560-426c-a382-92d7cb429510)

**1. Request Domain Name**

- `www.google.com`

**2. Check local DNS cache**

- Check local cache on device
- if IP address is found in cache, process ends, website is accessed directly

**3. Contact recursive DNS server(Resolver)**

- Recursive DNS server(Resolver) provided by ISP

**4. Recursive server lookup**

- Check Recursive server cache for IP address
- recursive DNS server has its own cache

**5. Query root name server**

- if recursive server does not have IP address, need to look in Authoritative DNS server
- query root name server for top level domain server
- root Nameservers respond to the `Recursive DNS Server's query` by providing the `IP addresses` of the `TLD Nameserver`

**6. Query TLD name server**

- `.com`
- TLD name server provides `IP address` of `Authoritative name server`
- what TLD name servers do have is the location of the authoritative name server for requested site

**7. Query Authoritative name server**

- `google.com`
- holds the `definitive IP address` for the domain

**8. Get IP address**

- passed through each level of DNS server until it reaches your device

**9. Access website**
