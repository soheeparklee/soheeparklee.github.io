## ✅ Domain Name

- **which computer** on network?
- correspond to `IP address`
- since `IP address` is too long to memorize, use `Domain Name` instead for humans
- In order to access a web site, need to get `IP address` with `Domain Name` from `Domain Name System`

For `IP address` and `Domain Name`, read this <https://soheeparklee.github.io/posts/n-4socketprogramming/> <br>

## ✅ Domain Name System

- DNS is a **distributed database** consisted of DNS servers in **hierarchy**

- application layer(layer 7)
- operates on UDP, port 53
- System to convert `Domain Name` to `IP address`
- can correspond several `IP address` to one `Domain Name`

> **What is the benefit of DNS being a hierarchical, distributed database?** <br>
>
> > DNS is used all around the world by many hosts <br>
> > by being distributed, more effective, scalable. <br>

## 📌 Domain Name System Operation

1. Type URI `www.google.com/index/html` on browser <br>
2. Browser will get `host name` `www.google.com` from URI, send to `DNS client` <br>
3. `DNS client` sends `host name` to `DNS server` <br>
4. `DNS server` responds `IP address` of `host name` to `DNS client` <br>
5. When browser recieves `IP address` from DNS, reset TCP connection to that `IP address` and `port 80` of that `IP address` to HTTP server process <br>

**✔️ DNS recursor**

- **recursive resolver**
- server that responds to DNS query
- ask another DNS server for IP address

**✔️ Root-Level DNS Server**

- name server for root zone
- classified from A to M
- more than 400 root-level DNS servers on internet

**✔️ Top-Level DNS Server**

- high-level DNS server
- such as `.com`, `.org`, `net`, `edu`
- from `www.google.com`, TLD server for the `.com` will respond
- national domains
- such as `.kr`, `.uk`, `.jp`

**✔️ Authoritative name server**

- organization, company domains
- final stop for DNS query
- authoritative name server has the DNS record for the request

**✔️ Local DNS server**

- operate as recursive resolver
- is not strictly part of DNS layer, but it is in the center of DNS structure
- ISP has local DNS
- ISP use local DNS to respond to host with IP address
- when host requests for DNS, requested to DNS server as proxy

## 📌 Types of DNS Service

**✔️ Recursive DNS resolver**

- DNS recursor
- DNS server that responds to DNS query
- asks for the authoritative name server

**✔️ Authoritative DNS server**

- server to store DNS request
- if requested for IP address, doesnt ask any other server
- Authoritative name server is the final authority of IP address

## 📌 How DNS functions

## 📌 DNS queries

**✔️ Recursive Query**

- computer requests IP address
- or the confirmation that the DNS server does not know that IP addres

**✔️ Iterative Query**

- requester asks DNS server for best answer again and again
- If DNS server doesnt have IP address ➡️ ask TLD name server ➡️ ask authoritative name server...
- continue iterative process until finding IP address, or timeout

**✔️ Non-recursive Query**

- DNS resolver uses this query to find IP address that it doesn't have in its cache

## 📌 DNS Cache

## ✅ Steps when URL is typed on a brower

- DNS cache
- DNS recursive server
