## ✅ Multiples of Bit

> bit, Byte, Kilo, Mega, Giga, Tera, Petta, Exa, Zelta, Yotta

- `1b = 1bit` = 0(`0.5v`) or 1(`5v`)
- `1B = 1byte` = `8 bits`
- `1KB(kilo)` = `1024 bytes`
- `1MB(Mega)` = `1024 bytes * 1024 bytes` = `1024KB`
- `1GB(Giga)` = `1024 bytes * 1024 bytes * 1024 bytes` = `1024MB`
- `1TB(Tera)` = `1024GB`
- `1PB(Petta)` = `1024TB` ➡️ does not exist yet ❌
- `1EB(Exa)` = `1024PB` ➡️ does not exist yet ❌
- `1ZB(Zelta)` = `1024EB` ➡️ does not exist yet ❌
- `1YB(Yotta)` = `1024ZB` ➡️ does not exist yet ❌

### 📚 Rule of Multiples of bit

- normally, bit is written on the right, YB on the left
- If you pass from **big ➡️ smaller** (from **left ➡️ right**)
- each step has a value of `multiplying by 1024(2^10)`
- except the last step, which is `byte ➡️ bit`
- which is `multiplied by 8 = 2^3`

- If you pass from **small ➡️ bigger** (from **right ➡️ left**)
- each step has a value of `divide by 1024(2^10)`
- which is the same as `multiplying by 2^(-10)`
- except the first step, which is `bit ➡️ byte`
- which is `divided by 8 = 2^3`
- which is the same as `divided by 2^(-3)`

## ❓ Exercises

```
Q: Transform/Convert 512TB into KB
A:
512TB
= 2^9TB
= (2^9) * (2^10) * (2^10) * (2^10) KB
= 2^39KB
👉🏻 2^39KB
```

```
Q: Transform/Convert 64YB into EB
A:
64YB
= 2^6YB
= (2^6) * (2^10) * (2^10) EB
= 2^26EB
👉🏻 2^26EB
```

```
Q: Transform/Convert 16TB into KB
A:
16TB
= 2^4TB
= (2^4) * (2^10) * (2^10) * (2^10)
= 2^34
👉🏻 2^34KB
```

```
Q: Transform/Convert 32MB into b
A:
32MB
= 2^5MB
= (2^5) * (2^10) * (2^10) * (2^3)
= 2^28
👉🏻 2^28b
```

```
Q: Transform/Convert 4MB into TB
A:
4MB
= 2^2MB
= (2^2) / (2^10) / (2^10)
= (2^2) * (2^(-10)) * (2^(-10))
= 2^(-18)
👉🏻 2^(-18)TB
```

```
Q: Transform/Convert 128TB into YB
A:
128TB
= 2^7TB
= (2^7) * (2^(-10)) * (2^(-10)) * (2^(-10)) * (2^(-10))
= 2^(-33)
👉🏻 2^(-33)YB
```

```
Q: Transform/Convert 2b into KB
A:
2b
= 2^1b
= (2^1) * (2^(-3)) * (2^(-10))
= 2^(-12)
👉🏻 2^(-12)KB
```
