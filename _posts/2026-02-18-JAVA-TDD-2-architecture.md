## ✅ Layered Architecutre in Spring

- ❓ why use layered architecture?
- separation of concerns
- to organize code by responsitbility

- Presentation Layer `Controller`: handles HTTP request & response
- Business Layer `Service` : business logic
- Persistence Layer `Repository, Data access`: access DB

- Controller 👉🏻 Service 👉🏻 Repository 👉🏻 Database

## ✅ Integration test

- 👎🏻 Unit test is limited to testing a single class in isolation
- In real life, several modules cooperate
- 👉🏻 check how multiple parts of the system interact together
