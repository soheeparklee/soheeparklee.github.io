## ✅ Inter Process Communication

> communication among processes <br>
> 💡 process have independent memory, is run independently <br>
> use semaphore, mutext(only one process for shared data) <br>

## ✅ Types of Inter Process Communication

1. Anonymous PIPE

   > **one way communication** <br>
   > PIPE can conenct two processes <br>
   > one process: only write, other process: only read <br>
   > used for when you know the other communicating process(like parent and child process communication) <br>
   > 👍🏻 simple to use <br>
   > 👎🏻 if both ways communication is needed, two PIPEs are required <br>

2. Named PIPE
   > when you don't know the other process to communicate <br> > **one way communication** <br>
3. Message Queue
   > Queue: unlike pipe, is memory <br>
   > several process can use numbered data <br>
4. Shared Memory
   > share data among processes <br>
   > 💡 process have independent memory, other process cannot access <br> > `Shared Memory` lets process ot share memory space <br>
   > 👍🏻 fastest in IPC <br>
5. Memory Map
   > like `Shared Memory`, but shares by mapping open file to memory <br>
   > share `file+memory` <br>
   > 👍🏻 for large files <br>
6. Socket
   > network socket communication <br>
   > client-server communication through socket <br>
   > server: bind, listen, accecpt/ client: connect <br>
