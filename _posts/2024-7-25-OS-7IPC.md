## ✅ Inter Process Communication

> communication among processes
> 💡 process have individual memory, is run individually
> use semaphore, mutext(only one process for shared data)

## ✅ Types of Inter Process Communication

1. Anonymous PIPE

   > **one way communication**
   > PIPE can conenct two processes
   > one process: only write, other process: only read
   > used for when you know the other communicating process(like parent and child process communication)
   > 👍🏻 simple to use
   > 👎🏻 if both ways communication is needed, two PIPEs are required

2. Named PIPE
   > when you don't know the other process to communicate
   > **one way communication**
3. Message Queue
   > Queue: unlike pipe, is memory
   > several process can use numbered data
4. Shared Memory
   > share data among processes
   > 💡 process have individual memory, other process cannot access
   > `Shared Memory` lets process ot share memory space
   > 👍🏻 fastest in IPC
5. Memory Map
   > like `Shared Memory`, but shares by mapping open file to memory
   > share `file+memory`
   > 👍🏻 for large files
6. Socket
   > network socket communication
   > client-server communication through socket
   > server: bind, listen, accecpt/ client: connect
