## ✅ This weeks achievements\_이번 주 목표 달성 여부

#### **What I learned\_알게된 점**

I renewed my carrot app using Svelte, Vite and Firebase.  
These tools made it easy to bundle, dpeloy and add a server to my App.  
Such useful new tools.

#### **What I tried\_스스로 시도해본 것들**

I added Svelte, Vite and FIrebase.
I also learned about web frameworks.
Authentication was difficult, logging with sha256 function.

#### **Trouble Shooting\_해결 내용**

I made a mistake of adding a firebase server to my github blog.  
I had to learn how to clear my server.  
Also, to check newly updates on firebase, it was not after deploying, but on the local server, just like my github blog!

#### **Looking back\_회고**

Started my new book, 후니의 네트워킹!
Studying with a book is always fun...I learned a lot about CS network.

## 🍀 Next week goals\_다음 주 목표 설정

Start my major course!  
I will study deeply about JAVA.
