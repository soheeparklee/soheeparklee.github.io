## Distro 🆚 Flavor

- ✔️ **Distro**: Type of linux(👀 Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat...)

- ✔️ **Flavor**: Graphical aspect of the distro
- desktop Environment of the Distro
- also called `DE`
- 👀 There can be several `flavors` of ubuntu
- difference between the flavors is normally the **hardware requirements**

```
Some people say
"I do not like ubuntu because it is so heavy"

But there can be a ubuntu with a lighter flavor.
```

```
👀 Imagine you have Ubuntu 24.04 3 LTS
- this means
- distro: Ubuntu
- version: 24.04 3 LTS

- if the version is too heavy/demanding
- no need to go back to Ubuntu 22

- 💊 use Lubuntu 24.04 3
- change flavor
- "L" means light

- if this flavor is not your type
- you also have Xubuntu 24.04 3
- this is also light

- If this flavor is not your graphical likes,
- you can also choose Kubuntu 24.04 3...

- 👉🏻 Stay with 24.04 3 LTS version
- change the flavor
```
