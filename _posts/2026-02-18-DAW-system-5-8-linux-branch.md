- `/` root directory: origin of the tree
- `root user`
- are not the same!

## ✅ Level 0

- `/` means root, origin of the tree
- `kernel`
- `root directory`
- all mean the same

## ✅ Level 1

- all have a name `/smth`
- we store the most important components of Linux
- ⚠️ they can never be deleted
- only `super user` can delete it

- 👀 `/bin`, `/home`, `/boot`, `/user`...

#### ☑️ Types of Level 1 branches

- ✔️ `/bin`
- binary files, executable files
- we have the commands that the users can execute

```
❓ I want user Diario to not be able to run a command
- I delete the command from /bin
- and move it to another place, and put a . on it
```

- ✔️ `/sbin`
- executable files for the super user
- commands that only the super user can execute

- ✔️ `/boot`
- partition with booting options
- we keep the `GRUB` if we have the legacy BIOS
- from `/boot`, if we chose UEFI, we will have `/boot/efi`
- and have the `GRUB` inside `/boot/efi`

- 💡 Note:
- sub branches(level 2 branch) can have different format from the main branch
- for example, `/boot` and `/boot/efi` can have different format

- 💡 Note:
- If we keep updating the Linux many times,
- `/boot` will keep growing and occupy all `1GB`
- 😱 Incident: so when you get a message `no space in /boot`
- 💊 ask `super user` to clean it
- with the command `sudo apt autoremove`
  - `sudo`: superuser do
  - `apt`: use the command in `apt`
  - `autoremove`: clean
- after this command, you can clean the `/boot`
- and go back to minimum `300MB`

- ✔️ `/dev`
- branch in which all the disks and partitions of disks are represented/stored

  - the mountpoint for all the disks and partitions of disks
  - 👀 `/dev/sda1`
  - `/dev/sda1` my partitions are hardware 🆚 `/dev` is software
  - so it is like a nickname

- ✔️ `/etc`
- for extras
- the most important first level branch!
- gives all the settings to the system
- the most important settings are there
- originally created for extra files,
- but after kernel 4, they started using it for the most important things
- 👀 users, passwords, setting files for my system...

- ✔️ `/home`
- personal folder
- dedicated to personal information
- in `/home`, there is a second level branch, per user
- so each user has each `/home`
- 👀 `/home/shpl`
- my personal folder will have a little nickname `~`
- `~` 🟰 `/home/shpl`
- if you send files to `~`, you are sending files to personal directories

❓ What do we have inside `~`?

- they will be level 3 branches
- Downloads(level 3), `/home/shpl/downloads`
- Desktop
- Documents
- Pictures
- Templates
- videos
- Music

- What we have in `~` 🟰 `/home/shpl` is only visible for me

- 💡 Note:
- If you want to hide/secret a file/folder
- then add a `.` in front
- 👀 `Downloads` ➡️ `.Downloads`

- ✔️ `/lib`
- specific files for making other files work
- in `lib` we have all the resources to run the commands for `/bin`

- ✔️ `/slib`
- library for the commands of the super user, that are in `sbin`

```
❓ If a command does not work, what is the two possibility happening?

1. we have a problem in the /lib
a missing /lib of that command
or corrupt library

2. the command disappeared from /bin
```

- ✔️ `/lib64`
- libraries for 64 bits
- nowadays everything is 64 bits
- so sometimes, this folder does not exist
- and everything is inside `/lib`

- ✔️ `/root`
- same as `/home` of the super user, which is `/home/su`
- `/root`: personal folder for super user
- when we become the super user, (⚠️ not recommended)
- our downloads, our pictures are no longer in `~`
- they will be inside `/root`

- ✔️ `/usr`
- folder shared by users
- folders for users in general
- when you want to share smth with the other user, put it in the `/usr` directory

- this branch is always surveyed by super user
- so if you want to do smth in `/usr` you need to get the permission of super user

- ✔️ `/sis`
- all the events of the kernel
- everything that happens in the kernel
- events of failure in the kernel
- 👀 IPC warning messages

- ✔️ `/proc`
- all the events of failure

- ✔️ `/srv`
- server
- everything connected to internet settings
- 👀 `/srv/www`: everything that happens when we navigate on the internet
- 👀 `/srv/ftp`: everything that happens when we upload, download files

```
❓ If smth fails while the navigaing the web, where is the errors saved?

- /proc

When things are not with an error while navigating in the web?
- it would be stored in /srv/www
```

```
⭐️ Cheatsheet ⭐️
/srv/www: when navigation on internet goes ok
/srv/ftp: when you upload file to internet
/proc: when navigation fails
/sis: when the kernel fails

❓ I have a kernel booting error. Where can I check the error?
➡️ /sis
```

- ✔️ `/opt`
- store all the optional things that do not come with the standard download with the linux
- 🟰 things that do not come in the standard repositories
- 🟰 things that do not come with default in linux

  - 👀 `tree`: command to show you the tree
  - but to run this command, you have to install this command manually
  - does not come with linux initialization settings
  - so it would be inside `/opt`


- ✔️ `/tmp`
- temporal files
- forbidden to delete it manually ❌
- if you delete it, some commands will fail

- ✔️ `/var`
- branch for saving important system information
- 👀 systems variables

- ✔️ `/media`
- related to extra devices that do not come by default in `/dev`
- 👀 my partitions are in `/dev`
- but if I install a CD reader, USB reader, camera(not standard)
- they will be stored in `/media`
- 👀 Guest Additions are considered a `iso`, so it will be stored in the `/media`

## 💡 / is the root and separator

- `/`: we have the kernel here
- but `/` is also a separator
- also used for separating the branches
- 👀 `/home/carlos` is a branch hanging from `/`

- branch 🟰 directory
- in Linux, we do not say folders, we say directories
