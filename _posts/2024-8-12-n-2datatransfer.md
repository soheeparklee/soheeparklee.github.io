## âœ… Packetization

Packets: <br>

- small segment of big original data
- `metadata(header)` âž• portion of original data

## âœ… Routing

- route packet through the network
- router, switches

## âœ… Transmission Medium

- wires, cables
- Protocols: TCP/IP

ðŸ’¡ Protocol <https://soheeparklee.github.io/posts/n-3protocol/>

## âœ… Reassembly

- in TCP, missing packets are retrasmitted

## âœ… Error Checking

- data integrity
- checksum
