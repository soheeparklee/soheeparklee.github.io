## ✅ Timeline of Operating Systems

- ✔️ **EXEC**
- appeared in '60s
- improved into `Microsoft` and `UNIX`

- ✔️ **MS-DOS**
- Microsoft Disk OS
- first OS created by Microsoft
- used commands
- not visual
- very technical, not for standard users

- ✔️ **Windows**
- Microsoft created OS that can reach standard users
- has easy-to-understand windows to run commands
- visual

- ✔️ **Windows 3.11**
- created the first digital barrier

```
💡 Digital barrier: digital development that breaks society in two groups
- divided ppl into ppl with windows 3.11 and ppl without
- if you had windows 3.11, you were considered high-tech
- ppl without windows 3.11 were considered low level tech professional
```

- ✔️ **More Window OS**
- Windows 95, 98, 2000, Millenium
- Effect 2000
- With `2000 and Windows Millenium`, ppl started feeling that they are spending too much money on Microsoft
- bc ppl had to buy two OS in one year, as Microsoft was releasing two per year
- Windows vista: very visual, but very slow
- Windows XP: very good OS
- Windows 7: very bad version
- Windows 8: very bad version
- Windows 10: perfct
- Windows 11:

- Microsoft was releasing every year a new OS
- and collapsing the market with too many produts in a very short time
- they were trying to sell so much

- ✔️ **UNIX**
- ↔️ In the meanwhile, UNIX appereared
- Unix improved into Linux
- Linux was free, more **stable**(no new version every year), not changing for a long time
- So technician changed to Linux, while standard public stayed w Windows

- ✔️ **MacOS**
- Mac is very independent
- so, not vey compatible with other systems `(rule number two)`
- losing its place in the market
- Iphone still have popularity, bc of `security(rule number three)`
- and also, iphone has good navigation(interface structure of the OS)
- interface structure: very easy to navigate

```
💡 Tech should be compatible
💡 Tech should be secure
💡 Tech should have good interface
```

- ✔️ **Phone OS**
- android had less impact than iphone when it appeared
- But in 2016, bc of the economic crisis, android wins over the iphone market
- and becomes number 1 in the OS market!
- now in 2025, android is the number 1 OS in the world
- future will be portable
- there are more phone than computers

- ✔️ **Window 11**
- did not occupy the market bc it has HW needs
- to use `Window 11`, we need a chip that is called `TPN` build on the motherboard
- so in order to update to `window 11`, you totally need to throw away and ahange your computer as well
- ppl do not want to throw away their computer for updating for` window 11`
- Developers should listen to customer needs, if ppl will not throw away computer for your OS, you cannot develop this OS with special chip.

- 👉🏻 **So to summarize...**
- Do not collapse the market! Be innovative
- NO digital barriers! Technology should be equal
- Make stable things, like stable linux
- Technology should be compatible
- Technology should be secure
- Navigation inerface should be well designed
- Listen to customer needs

- ✔️ **OS should compete in the market of OS**
- chrome navigator also tried to compete into the OS market, but failed

## 💡 Tech rules

💡 **Rule number one.**

- Technicians should NOT create digital barriers
- should not break society into classes
- when technology should be global

💡 **Rule numnber two.**

- tech should be compatible

💡 **Rule numnber three.**

- tech should be secure
