## ✅ ORM

> Object Relational Mapping

- Map `object` and `relational DB` automatically
- save burden to code SQL

<br>

- **Object oriented programming**: use class
- **Relational DB**: use table
- thus, there is mismatch between `Object model` and `Relational model`
- ORM maps the relation between objects, create SQL

- 👍🏻 with OOP, focus more on business logic
- 👍🏻 code reusability
- 👍🏻 less dependent on DBMS
- 👎🏻 difficult to create service with only ORM
- 👎🏻 difficult when there is a lot of procedure
- 👎🏻 less functions than MyBatis

## ✅ MyBatis

- manage framework, SQL
- 👍🏻 more functions than ORM
- 👎🏻 need SQL coding
- 👎🏻 need to manage between object and database
