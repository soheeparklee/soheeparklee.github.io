## ‚úÖ Neumann Architecture

> explains how the computer works inside <br>
> architecture of a computer <br>

- This way of explaining architecture a computer has been valid since 1945

## ‚úÖ 3 parts of computer in Neumann

- ‚úîÔ∏è **A - Control Unit: CU**
- brain/boss of the computer
- give orders to the other units
- ‚≠êÔ∏è **controls, sets the rythm/pace** of the computer
- ‚≠êÔ∏è synchronizes the computer

- ‚úîÔ∏è **B - Arithmetic-Logic Unit: ALU**
- staff/workers of the computer
- ‚≠êÔ∏è part of the computer that really works/caculates
- use automatic gates `= logic gates`

#### üè† both `CU` and `ALU` are inside the **microprocessor, CPU**

- **CPU: Central Processing Unit**
- CPU = `CU` + `ALU`
- üí° and the `MU` is inside the RAM

- ‚úîÔ∏è **C - Main Memory Unit: MU**
- = RAM
- storing information, open process
- in a computer, secondary memory(harddisk) is not mandatory
- thus, in Neumann, we do not talk about secondary memory(harddisk) which is optional
- RAM is mandatory

## üìå (A) Control Unit

> sets the pace/rythm, controls and synchronizes the computer

- in a computer, process needs a **fixed rythm/pace**

### ‚ùì **What would happen if a computer did not have rythm?**

- without fixed rythm/pace, computer would be in chaos
- computer with no order would make an empty RAM
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Empty RAM**
- every process will take out information from RAM, but they will not have time to put information inside
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Unevenly distributed data among process**
- The data will not be evenly shared among the processes
- some process will take huge amounts, others will take very small prieces of data
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Chaotic peripherals**
- example: mouse that works both ways(input, output)
- the mouse is bi-peripheral(entering information and also showing information of where I am)
- wo a Control Unit, peripherals will not work properly
- when you don't want to click, it will click, when you want to move, it will not move

### ‚ùì **What happens when a computer has a rythm**

- computers need a rythm
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **processes are organized**
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **peripherals worked the way as intended**
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **jobs get done**

### ‚òëÔ∏è Two rythms of computer

- There are two rythms inside a computer
- each part of the computer _chooose_ between two rythms
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clock**: slow rythm
  - example: standard hard disk: moves with plates
  - reading from a harddisk, we read information as `clock based rythm`
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Micro-orders**: fast rythm
  - example: mouse
  - mouse moves at `micro-orders` speed

### ‚òëÔ∏è Internal blocks of CU

[![Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-24-03.png](https://i.postimg.cc/WpZqpYLf/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-24-03.png)](https://postimg.cc/6T9pY0Qd)

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **(a) Clock**: block inside CU that creates the **slow** rythm/pace/signal in the computer

[![Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-20-59.png](https://i.postimg.cc/j2xcTp3x/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-20-59.png)](https://postimg.cc/7GR0MWyd)

- tiny quartz crystal, looks like a tiny tiny cube
- so tiny that we do not see with eyes
- clock produces electricity without having to be plugged in
- produces a tiny wave automatically with several levels of electicity
- next to the clock, there is a block that converts the wave/radiation coming from a clock(looks like a wave) into a square radiation
- the square waves are simmilar to the ones of the power smaller
- this tiny square wave is not used to give electivity to other devices ‚ùå
- this square wave is used to set the pace ‚≠ïÔ∏è
- In the transition from `0` to `1`, that is one rythm
- when the clock makes a transition from `0` to `1`, all the computer feels that transition

- üí° Clock can NEVER STOP
- even if the computer is off, Clock does not stop

- in which the moment the clock is `1`, is divided into portions
- are the moments of `1` are split into portions
- these small portions would be `micro-orders`(fast)

- Thus, after every clock stroke, there are some `micro-orders`(fast)

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **(b) Sequencer**: chip that divides the clock `1` to `micro-order`

- sequencer would create the `fast micro-order`
- ‚≠êÔ∏è _Clock_ and _Sequencer_ would create the slow and fast rythms for the computer

```
Program: when applications are closed and are stored on secondary memory
Process: when application is open, and are on RAM
- processes are fragmented, broken are into pieces and saved on RAM
- they are NOT saved continguously
```

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **(c) Program Counter**

- block that contains the next address of the running process
- PC tells me where I can find the _next portion_ of the process that I am running on the RAM
- somebody needs to tell me to look where to look next in the RAM
- as processes are _fragmented_ and stored on RAM
- for addressing in RAM, we use hexadecimal
- ‚≠êÔ∏è thus the PC stores the **hexadecimal address** in which I am going to find the next instructions
- program counter does not tell me the instructions ‚ùå
- program counter tells me **where(address)** to go to find the instructions ‚≠ïÔ∏è

#### ‚úÖ **Indirect Addressing**

This way of getting address is called: Indirect Addressing

- does not tell me the instructions
- but tells me where I can find the instructions
- üëéüèª This indirect addressing _slows_ the computer, as I have to get the address, go to RAM, come back...
- ‚ùì Why do we use indirect addressing?
- for **security**
- much more secure bc the information is **split/distributed** among several components

- üí° the addresses are called: Pointers

```
if PC: A2h
need to go to RAM address A2h
in address A2h, I will find the next instructions
```

- When I go to the address, I will find instructions in `4 portions`
- Instructions are always divided into `4 portions`, has same length
- When we take the `4 portions` of instructions, we will save them in Instruction Register

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **(d)Instruction Register**

- save the `4 portions` that I found with the help of `PC` on `IR`
- Instruction Register will contain the `4 portions` of instructions that I found on the RAM
- IR has 4 parts, one per portion

#### üí° **Instructions are in `4 portions`.**

- Every instruction in computing is consited of 4 parts
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Operation code:
  - most of the operations are in the end mathematical operations
  - exmaple: `SUM`, `SUBS(substracting)`, `MUL(multiplying)`, `DIV(dividing)`, `SQT(square root)`
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Address of the First number:
  - however, does not give me the number directly ‚ùå
  - will give me address of the RAM where I can find the first number `B3h` ‚≠ïÔ∏è
  - also indirect addressing
  - go to RAM `B3h` and you will find the first number
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Address of the Second number:
  - give me the address of the RAM where I can find the second number `A5h`
  - I need to go to `A5h` in RAM to find the second number
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Address of the result
  - after making the caculation, I look at the 4th portion of the instruction
  - and save the result at that address in the RAM

```
If IR is SUM B2 C3 E1
- add
- what you find in RAM address B2
- with what you find in RAM address C3
- then save the result in E1 in RAM
```

#### ‚úÖ 32 bits, 64 bits computer

- In a computer of `32bits`, each of the addresses have `32bits`
- 8 hexadecimal characters, example: `FFFFFFFFh`
- In a computer of `64bits`, each of the addresses have `64bits`
- 8 hexadecimal characters, example: `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh`
- Thus, the `Instruction Registers` is the longest stucture of the block

#### ‚úîÔ∏è **(e) Decoder**

- helper/breaker for Instruction Register
- help the very long `Instruction Register` and break it into 4 portions

## üìå (B) Arithmetic Logic Unit

> in charge of making the caculations <br>

- contains **real data**‚≠ïÔ∏è, not the address ‚ùå
- real data **coming from**, or **going to** the RAM

[![Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-25-52.png](https://i.postimg.cc/SsFqgrTf/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-25-52.png)](https://postimg.cc/Z9c1RrhW)

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (a) Input Register A `InRA`

- contains the first number that comes from the RAM

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (b) Input Register B `InRB`

- contains the second number that comes from the RAM

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (c) Operational Circuit

- contains the logic gates
- does the math operations
- Operational Circuit used to be triangle, thats why has triangle in the middle

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (d) ACCUM

- accumulator
- block that will accumulate the result before sending it to the RAM
- it is NOT a permanent storage ‚ùå
- a temporal storage ‚≠ïÔ∏è

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (e) State Register

- In some math operations, special things can happen
- what to do when special operations have to be run
- state registers contains üö© flags for each of the special operations that could happen
- If it is a normal operation, the state registers will be off, `example: 5+3=8`
- however, if it is a special operation, state register will be on `example: caculation overflow!`
- _example of special operation:_ `dividing by 0`, `5+5= 10 so we have to keep 0 and carry 1`

#### üö© **We have 6 flags**

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ `Flag S`: if sign flag is 1, result is negative number
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ `Flag Z`: if zero flag is up, if the result is 0
  - in order to avoid dividing by 0
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è so If flag Z is up, we should not divide! Divisions are controlled.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ `Flag V`: overflow flag is up, when the result of the caculation exceeds than the possible number of bits managable by ALU
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ `Flag P`: parity flag is `1` when in ECC error checking group, when the result of the subgroup is `1`, when I have to add `1` bc the number of `1` is odd
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ `Flag C`: carry flag is `1` when I have to carry 1, like in `1+1 = 10 and I have to carry 1`
- 6Ô∏è‚É£ `Flag I`: Interrupt flag is `1` when there an interruption, when the anti-virus detects malware(all intrusions), the computer gets frozen, until the anti-virus quarantines the malware

  - Interrupt flag is also `1` when high temperature is detected, to turn on the ventilator
  - so sometimes the ventilator is connected to the interrupt flag

## üìå (C) Memory Unit

[![Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-26-46.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FFG5SN4C/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-15-26-46.png)](https://postimg.cc/5jHRdcj8)

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (a) Memory Selector

- Memory unit has an automatic selector(like an elevator) that is called `Memory Selector`
- that selects the level/address I want to reach
- it moves up and down the RAM and reaches the address
- `Memory Selector` can go from `00000000h` to `FFFFFFFFh`
- sometimes, if there is an error, the `Memory Selector` can go to the `OS area` in RAM which is prohibited

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (b) Memory Address Register `MAR`

- At the entrance of the RAM
- there is a block to check if the address we are trying to reach is 1Ô∏è‚É£ valid and 2Ô∏è‚É£ free
- checker of addresses
- `MAR` does not move, only lets entering RAM

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (c) Memory Data/Swap Register `MDR/MSR`

- If the address is correct, `MAR` lets entrance to RAM
- `Memory Selector` goes up and down the RAM, and gets the information
- and gives it to `MDR`
- `MDR` is the delivery man of the data
- takes the information **in/out** of the RAM

#### ‚úîÔ∏è (d) Read/Write `R/W`

- like a flag
- This block has a value of `0` if we **read** from the RAM
- This block has a value of `1` if we **write** inside the RAM

## ‚úÖ Three Fixed paths

> The transmission of information between different blocks always have to follow a fixed path

- All these paths are independent

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Address Bus**

- To transmit address among blocks, all the addresses travel along the address bus
- address bus is a set of wires

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Data bus**

- To transmit numbers among blocks, use the data bus
- to transmit the real numbers

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Control bus**

- All pace signals(`clock` and the `micro orders`) travel through the control bus

## ‚úÖ Bus

- when there is only one wire, bits travel by `serial`, `one by one`, `one behind the other`
- But if we have sets of wire(always set of 8)
- we say` "We have a Bus"(many wires)`
- 8 bits can travel at once
- bits go out in `parallel`
- by groups of 8

- communication `serial`: means `one by one`
- communication `parallel`: means `by groups`, `by bus`
- üëçüèª normally, `parallel` is faster
- üëâüèª so in a **neumann** computer, we use `parallel`, we use `bus`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Exception of BUS

- is USB
- **USB**: Univeral _Serial_ Bus
- in a USB, bits go by `one by one`
- Still USB is fast, bc of a high, fast cadency ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- cadency: speed of communication

## üìå Instructions Cycle

> how does a computer work?

- 1. `Clock` enters the `Sequencer`
- 2. `Sequencer` creates the micro-orders
- 3. `Clock` and micro-orders travels through the `control bus`
- 4. A user would open a program
- 5. Program is converted into a process
- 6. The process is fragmented into fragments, and stored on the RAM, by `OS`
  - (does not go through MAR/MS/MDR/R/W)
- 7. In this state, RAM `R/W` would be in _write_
- 8. `Program Counter` is loaded with the address of the first instruction
- 9. This address travels through the `address bus`
- 10. This address is shown to the `Memory Address Register`, to be validated/if RAM is free
- 11. If valid, `Memory Selector` moves to the address
- 12. In this state, RAM `R/W` would change to _read_
- 13. The 4 portions of the instruction is given to `Memory Data Register`
- 14. The 4 portions of data travel through the `data bus`
- 15. They arrive and are stored to the `Instruction Register`
- 16. Fragment 1 travels through `data bus` and is given to `Operating Circuit` that contains the logic gates, open gates are turned on
- 17. Fragment 2, the address of the first number, travels through the `address bus`
- 18. This address is shown to the `Memory Address Register`, to be validated/if RAM is free
- 19. If valid, `Memory Selector` moves/reaches to the address
- 20. Read the data in the address, `Memory Data Register` gets the data
- 21. The data travels through the `data bus`
- 22. The data is given to `Input Register A`
- 23. Fragment 3, the address of the second number, travels through the `address bus`
- 24. This address is shown to the `Memory Address Register`, to be validated/if RAM is free
- 25. If valid, `Memory Selector` moves/reaches to the address
- 26. Read the data in the address, give the second number to `Memory Data Register`
- 27. `Memory Data Register` sends the data travels through the `data bus`
- 28. The data is given to `Input Register B`
- 29. `Input Register A` and `Input Register B` give the data to `Operating Circuit`
- 30. `Operating Circuit` does the caculation
- 31. `Operating Circuit` gives the result to the `ACCUM`
- 32. If there is no special operation, `State R` stays off
- 33. Fragment 4, address to store the result travels through the `address bus`
- 34. This address is shown to the `Memory Address Register`, to be validated/if RAM is free

35. If valid, `Memory Selector` moves/reaches to the address
36. In this state, RAM `R/W` changes to _write_
37. The data from `ACCUM` travels through the `data bus`
38. `Memory Data Register` gets the information from `ACCUM`

- So, `Memory Data Register` has two roles, giving and recieving data
- Until now, `Memory Data Register` has been always extracting information from the RAM
- but in step 38, recieves incoming information from the ALU

39. `Memory Selector` reaches the address, then saves the data on the RAM
40. Next step, `Memory Address Register` gets emptied
41. `Operating Circuit` gets emptied
42. logic gates will be turned off
43. `Program Counter` will now point to the next instruction, instruction 2, and every step will be repeated.

## üìå Speed of the cycle

- This is the only way of making things organized
- without blocking the computer
- as instructions keep coming

- All these 43 steps happen at the speed of clock of `2GHz`, `2000 000 000 times per second`
- computer has no brain
- it is just electric signs traveling
