## ✅ Neumann Architecture

> explains how the computer works inside <br>
> architecture of a computer <br>

- This way of explaining architecture a computer has been valid since 1945

## ☑️ 3 parts of computer in Neumann

- ✔️ **A - Control Unit: CU**
- brain/boss of the computer
- **controls, sets the rythm** of the computer
- give orders to the other units

- ✔️ **B - Arithmetic-Logic Unit: ALU**
- staff/workers of the computer
- part of the computer that really works/caculates
- use automatic gates `= logic gates`

- 🏠 both `CU` and `ALU` are inside the **microprocessor, CPU**

  - **CPU: Central Processing Unit**
  - CPU = `CU` + `ALU`

- ✔️ **C - Main Memory Unit: MU**
- = RAM
- storing information
- in a computer, secondary memory(harddisk) is not mandatory
- thus, in Neumann, we do not talk about secondary memory(harddisk) which is optional
- RAM is mandatory
