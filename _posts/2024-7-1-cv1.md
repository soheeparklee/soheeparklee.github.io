문제해결에 몰입하는
문제가 없을 때보다 문제가 생겼을 때 더 흥미를 느끼는
버그가 좋은
what if?를 고민하며 엣지 케이스를 대비하는

관심 있는 개발분야
외부로 보여지지 않는 컴퓨터의 원리를 파악하는게 흥미롭다
당연하고 자연스럽게 여겨지는 것들의 작동 원리를 알아가거나 개선할 때

개발의 어떤 점
문제가 생겼을 때 해결을 위해 몇 시간씩 몰입하는게 좋다.

흥미를 가지고 무엇을 했는지
http를 https로 설정하는 작업을 백엔드에서

커리어 플랜
네트워크, 데이터, 보안

에러가 발생했을 때 끈질기게 파고드는 몰입이 좋아서 점점 문제를 해결해나가다보니 개발을 하게 되었습니다.
특히 외부로 보여지지 않는 작동 원리를 이해하고 개선할 때 feel driven해서 백엔드 분야를 공부하고 있습니다.
특히 네트워크, 데이터베이스, 보안에 관심이 많아 프로젝트에서 이런 부분을 담당했습니다.

Project Proposal
https://project-movie-reservation.notion.site/DrugStore-Website-Project-d3fdec29c4d0473598382580b1416897

Implemented JASYPT for encrypting confidential data to enhance security. With the implementaion of Jasypt, the number of enviormental variables stored in the yaml file decreased from 19 to 1.

Deployed on cloud server using AWS EC2 and RDS.

Configured Nginx, SSL, certbox and AWS Route 53 for HTTPS domain. Resulted in higher security as well as faster speed in registering products, from 9.26 seconds to 369 milliseconds.

Utilized Redis for email verification. 
Applied AWS S3 for uploading multipart files such as images.
Implemented different functionalities based on user roles. Different features are supported depending on the roles of seller and buyer, user and admin user.
Potential issues such as when products are sold out or when there is insufficient stock were anticipated and exception handling has been done thouroughly.
