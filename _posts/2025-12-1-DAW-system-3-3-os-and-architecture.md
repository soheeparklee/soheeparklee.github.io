- x86 is like a small house
- x64 is like a big house

- OS if 32 bits is a small lamp
- OS of 64 bits is a big lamp

- ❓ Can I add a small lamp on a small house?
- I can add `32 bits` OS on **x86**
- ❓ Can I add a small or big lamp on a big house?
- I can add 32 `bits OS or 64 bits` on **x64**

✔️ **Backwards compatibility**

- Fact of having x64(new, big) respecting 32 bits OS(old, small)
- is called Backwards compatibility
- 👀 Playstation 5 is not backwards compatible with playstation 2

❓ When would you have to install a 32 bits OS on a 64 bits architecture?

- bc you want to save money, you do not want to buy a new 64 bits OS
- sometimes, companies have 32 bits licences, and they just use them, as it is compatible

✔️ **How to combine**

- Obviously, if you can choose, `32 with 32`, and `64 with 64` is the best choice

```
❓ Can I install on a x86 computer a 40GB application?

👉🏻 NO,
- on a x86, you only can install a 32 bit OS
- so the files have to be the same or smaller than 4GB

👉🏻 Maybe you can install partial parts of the application

❓ Can I install on a x86 computer a 4GB application?
👉🏻 Yes.
❓ Can I install on a x86 computer a 4.0001GB application?
👉🏻 NO
