## ✅ How to make a screenshot

- PrintScreen
- Herramienta Recortes(comes from windows 10)
- shortcut: `windows key` + `shift` + `s` (for multi window technique)

## ✅ ITIL

> Information Technology Infrastucture Language <br>
> way of working in computer systems <br>

### ☑️ ITIL can have two meanings

#### 1️⃣ The structure of a systems company

- ✔️ **Level 1**: specific platform/program named `Dashboard` for solving customer technical problems/issues
- the issues are called `tickets`
- so solve `tickets` in `dashboard`
- typical to remote work

- workers are evaluated by customers
- in level 1, customers are obliged to, they must evaluate you
- customers will be evaluating the worker from `1~10`
  - `from 0~6`: bad grade, detractor, fail
  - `7~8`: neutral, the service was ok, nothing special
  - `9~10`: promoters, customer liked your service

- NPS: Net Promoter Score
- how many customers liked your service - how many customers did not like you
- neutral `7~8` do not count
- if your `NPS > 80` you get a bonus
- if your `NPS < 50` the company will deduct your optionals(like restaurant tickets)
- if your `50 < NPS < 80` evaluation neutral, nothing happens

- 👎🏻 very pressuring method for the worker
- 👎🏻 creates lots of internal competition
- a worker should be in `level 1` for just 3~6 months
- bc it is a very stressful environemnt of working

```
❓ Sohee has solved 200 tickets
100 gave her a 6
20 gave her a 7
20 gave her a 8
25 gave her a 9
35 gace her a 10

👉🏻 NPS = (60/200)*100 - (100/200)*100 = 30 - 50 = -20
She will be deducted her optionals
⚠️ NPS can be negative
```

- ⚠️ NPS is especially dangerous, bc normally people think 5 is an ok score
- However, in NPS 5 is bad, even 7, 8 does not count
- ❌ And it is illegal to tell your customer `If you liked me, pls give me a 9 or 10.`
- ⭕️ But it is mandatory to explain. `When you do the evaluation, lower than 6 means bad. 7-8 means nothing special. 9-10 means good. `

- ✔️ **Level 2**: support team to solve more professional/difficult issues than level 1
- evaulation is done by your boss

- ✔️ **Level 3**: extra or expert support team
- going/travel go the company that has the problem and solve it
- go and see physically the problem
- 👎🏻 Too much traveling could be tiring

#### 2️⃣ Format of systems

- All the documents, creations should have exactly the **same format**
- 👀 All your documents should start by `SIBIL`
- 👀 All the files should end with a international date format `2025Dec21`
- then all files should be something like, `SIBIL_examplefile_2025Dec21`
- if your format is wrong, the company will not accrpt your file

- If Virtual Machine are `ITIL`, need to have a special name, expressoin, structure
- If you do not keep the `ITIL`, it is not acceptable

- instead of creating a complete, final, perfect project ❌
- minimize and create partial versions to release ⭕️
- publish partial/little products

✔️ **Sprint**

- two weeks cycle
- and after the sprint, do a **sprint review**
- in the **sprint review**, explain what you did last two weeks, show your progress

✔️ **Sprint review and evaluation**

- comment with an anonymous evaluations
- commend on things you can improve
- no numbers, no bonus or no bonus..
- goal of sprint review: **team improving**

✔️ **Sprint names and progress evaluation**

- Sprints belong to a project
- normally the project lasts one year
- and the project has a name 👀 `SIBIL`
- then, all the documents related to this project should have the name, start with `SIBIL`

- every two weeks, there will be a **progress evaluation by your boss**
- 👀 RACE, how you are doing in learning outcomes and evaluation criteria
- 👀 RA should be passed, by `RA > 5`
- 👀 But the portions, evaluation criteria can be failed
- 👀 evaluation criteria is weighed, some CE has more weight than others

✔️ **Sprint always has soft skills**

- Apart from grading, there are always soft skills
- In systems, there are three soft skills
  - 1️⃣ Digital competence
  - 2️⃣ Punctuality(if the door is closed, that means you are late)
  - 3️⃣ Intercommunication skills
