## ✅ Micro Service Architecture

> application is developed as a collection of services <br>
> large application separated into smaller independent parts<br>

- each service gets to develop, deploy, has own responsibility
- 👍🏻 no single point of failure
- 👍🏻 each service can be developed in different language, framework
- 👍🏻 scalability
- 👎🏻 testing, transaction among services might be more different
- 👎🏻 communicate in API, cost of APIs
- 👎🏻 difficult to trace error and debug among several services
